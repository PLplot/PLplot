  This sets up the length of the minor ticks and the length of the
  terminals on error bars. The actual length is the product of the default
  length and a scaling factor as for character height.

  def (PLFLT, input): The default length of a minor tick in millimeters,
  should be set to zero if the default length is to remain unchanged.

  scale (PLFLT, input): Scale factor to be applied to default to get
  actual tick length.
