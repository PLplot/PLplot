  pltext

  Sets an interactive device to text mode, used in conjunction with plgra
  to allow graphics and text to be interspersed. On a device which supports
  separate text and graphics windows, this command causes control to be
  switched to the text window. This can be useful for printing diagnostic
  messages or getting user input, which would otherwise interfere with the
  plots. The user _m_u_s_t switch back to the graphics window before issuing plot
  commands, as the text (or console) device will probably become quite
  confused otherwise. If already in text mode, this command is ignored. It is
  also ignored on devices which only support a single window or use a
  different method for shifting focus (also plgra).
