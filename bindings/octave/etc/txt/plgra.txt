  plgra

  Sets an interactive device to graphics mode, used in conjunction with
  pltext to allow graphics and text to be interspersed. On a device which
  supports separate text and graphics windows, this command causes control to
  be switched to the graphics window. If already in graphics mode, this
  command is ignored. It is also ignored on devices which only support a
  single window or use a different method for shifting focus. See also
  pltext.
