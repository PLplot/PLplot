  plstar(nx, ny)
  **************

  plstar

  Initializing the plotting package. The program prompts for the device
  keyword or number of the desired output device. Hitting a RETURN in
  response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device. If only
  one device is enabled when PLplot is installed, plstar will issue no
  prompt. The output device is divided into nx by ny sub-pages, each of which
  may be used independently. The subroutine pladv is used to advance from one
  subpage to the next.

  nx (PLINT, input): Number of subpages to divide output page in the
  horizontal direction.

  ny (PLINT, input): Number of subpages to divide output page in the
  vertical direction.
