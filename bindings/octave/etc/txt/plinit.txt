  plinit()

  plinit

  Initializing the plotting package. The program prompts for the device
  keyword or number of the desired output device. Hitting a RETURN in
  response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device. plinit
  will issue no prompt if either the device was specified previously (via
  command line flag or the plsdev function), or if only one device is enabled
  when PLplot is installed. If subpages have been specified, the output
  device is divided into nx by ny sub-pages, each of which may be used
  independently. If plinit is called again during a program, the previously
  opened file will be closed. The subroutine pladv is used to advance from
  one subpage to the next.
