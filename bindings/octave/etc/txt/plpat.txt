  plpat(nlin, inc, del)
  *********************

  plpat

  Sets the area fill pattern. The pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of
  parallel lines with specified inclinations and spacings. The arguments to
  this routine are the number of sets to use (1 or 2) followed by two
  pointers to integer arrays (of 1 or 2 elements) specifying the inclinations
  in tenths of a degree and the spacing in micrometers. (also see plpsty)

   nlin (PLINT, input): Number of sets of lines making up the pattern,
  either 1 or 2.

   inc (PLINT *, input): Pointer to array with nlin elements. Specifies the
  line inclination in tenths of a degree. (Should be between -900 and 900).

   del (PLINT *, input): Pointer to array with nlin elements. Specify the
  spacing in micrometers between the lines making up the pattern.
