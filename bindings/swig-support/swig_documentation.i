DESCRIPTION:

    Advances to the next subpage if sub=0, performing a page advance if
    there are no remaining subpages on the current page.  If subpages
    aren't being used, pladv(0) will always advance the page.  If page>0,
    PLplot switches to the specified subpage.  Note that this allows you
    to overwrite a plot on the specified subpage; if this is not what you
    intended, use pleop followed by plbop to first advance the page.  This
    routine is called automatically (with page=0) by plenv, but if plenv
    is not used, pladv must be called after initializing PLplot but before
    defining the viewport.

        h: Draws a grid at the minor tick interval.
        i: Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn outwards, rather than
        inwards.
        l: Labels axis logarithmically.  This only affects the labels,
        not the data, and so it is necessary to compute the logarithms
        of data points before passing them to any of the drawing
        routines.

DESCRIPTION:

    Plots a histogram consisting of nbin bins.	The value associated with
    the i'th bin is placed in x[i], and the number of points in the bin is
    placed in y[i].  For proper operation, the values in x[i] must form a
    strictly increasing sequence.  By default, x[i] is the left-hand edge
    of the i'th bin. If opt=PL_BIN_CENTRED is used, the bin boundaries are
    placed midway between the values in the x vector.  Also see plhist for
    drawing histograms from unbinned data.

    x (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :     A vector containing values associated
    with bins.  These must form a strictly increasing sequence.

    y (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :     A vector containing a number which is
    proportional to the number of points in each bin.  This is a PLFLT
    (instead of PLINT) vector so as to allow histograms of
    probabilities, etc.

    opt (PLINT, input) :    Is a combination of several flags:
    opt=PL_BIN_DEFAULT: The x represent the lower bin boundaries, the
    outer bins are expanded to fill up the entire x-axis and bins of
    zero height are simply drawn.
        opt=PL_BIN_CENTRED|...: The bin boundaries are to be midway
        between the x values. If the values in x are equally spaced,
        the values are the center values of the bins.
        opt=PL_BIN_NOEXPAND|...: The outer bins are drawn with equal
        size as the ones inside.
        opt=PL_BIN_NOEMPTY|...: Bins with zero height are not drawn
        (there is a gap for such bins).

%feature( "docstring", "Begin a new page

DESCRIPTION:

    Begins a new page.	For a file driver, the output file is opened if
    necessary.	Advancing the page via pleop and plbop is useful when a
    page break is desired at a particular point when plotting to subpages.
     Another use for pleop and plbop is when plotting pages to different
    files, since you can manually set the file name by calling plsfnam
    after the call to pleop. (In fact some drivers may only support a
    single page per file, making this a necessity.)  One way to handle
    this case automatically is to page advance via pladv, but enable
    familying (see plsfam) with a small limit on the file size so that a
    new family member file will be created on each page break.

    The PLplot definition of broken-down time is a calendar time that
    completely ignores all time zone offsets, i.e., it is the user's
    responsibility to apply those offsets (if so desired) before using the
    PLplot time API.  By default broken-down time is defined using the
    proleptic Gregorian calendar without the insertion of leap seconds and
    continuous time is defined as the number of seconds since the Unix

SYNOPSIS:

ARGUMENTS:

    rx (PLFLT, input) :    Input relative device coordinate (0.0-1.0) for
    the x coordinate.

    ry (PLFLT, input) :    Input relative device coordinate (0.0-1.0) for

    wy (PLFLT_NC_SCALAR, output) :    Returned value of the y world

    ry.

    window (PLINT_NC_SCALAR, output) :      Returned value of the last
    defined window index that corresponds to the input relative device
    coordinates (and the returned world coordinates).  To give some
    background on the window index, for each page the initial window
    index is set to zero, and each time plwind is called within the
    page, world and device coordinates are stored for the window and
    the window index is incremented.  Thus, for a simple page layout
    with non-overlapping viewports and one window per viewport, window
    corresponds to the viewport index (in the order which the
    viewport/windows were created) of the only viewport/window
    corresponding to rx and ry.  However, for more complicated layouts
    with potentially overlapping viewports and possibly more than one

%feature( "docstring", "Plot color bar for image, shade or gradient plots

DESCRIPTION:

    Routine for creating a continuous color bar for image, shade, or
    gradient plots. (See pllegend for similar functionality for creating
    legends with discrete elements). The arguments of plcolorbar provide
    control over the location and size of the color bar as well as the
    location and characteristics of the elements (most of which are
    optional) within that color bar.  The resulting color bar is clipped
    at the boundaries of the current subpage. (N.B. the adopted coordinate
    system used for some of the parameters is defined in the documentation
    of the position parameter.)

    Redacted form: plcolorbar(p_colorbar_width, p_colorbar_height, opt,
    position, x, y, x_length, y_length, bg_color, bb_color, bb_style,
    low_cap_color, high_cap_color, cont_color, cont_width, label_opts,
    labels, axis_opts, ticks, sub_ticks, values)

    This function is used in examples 16 and 33.



SYNOPSIS:

plcolorbar(p_colorbar_width, p_colorbar_height, opt, position, x, y, x_length, y_length, bg_color, bb_color, bb_style, low_cap_color, high_cap_color, cont_color, cont_width, n_labels, label_opts, labels, naxes, axis_opts, ticks, sub_ticks, n_values, values)

ARGUMENTS:

    p_colorbar_width (PLFLT_NC_SCALAR, output) :    Returned value of the
    labelled and decorated color bar width in adopted coordinates.

    p_colorbar_height (PLFLT_NC_SCALAR, output) :    Returned value of the
    labelled and decorated color bar height in adopted coordinates.

    opt (PLINT, input) :    opt contains bits controlling the overall
    color bar.  The orientation (direction of the maximum value) of
    the color bar is specified with PL_ORIENT_RIGHT, PL_ORIENT_TOP,
    PL_ORIENT_LEFT, or PL_ORIENT_BOTTOM.  If none of these bits are
    specified, the default orientation is toward the top if the
    colorbar is placed on the left or right of the viewport or toward
    the right if the colorbar is placed on the top or bottom of the
    viewport. If the PL_COLORBAR_BACKGROUND bit is set, plot a
    (semitransparent) background for the color bar. If the
    PL_COLORBAR_BOUNDING_BOX bit is set, plot a bounding box for the
    color bar. The type of color bar must be specified with one of
    PL_COLORBAR_IMAGE, PL_COLORBAR_SHADE, or PL_COLORBAR_GRADIENT. If
    more than one of those bits is set only the first one in the above
    list is honored. The position of the (optional) label/title can be
    specified with PL_LABEL_RIGHT, PL_LABEL_TOP, PL_LABEL_LEFT, or
    PL_LABEL_BOTTOM.  If no label position bit is set then no label
    will be drawn. If more than one of this list of bits is specified,
    only the first one on the list is honored. End-caps for the color
    bar can added with PL_COLORBAR_CAP_LOW and PL_COLORBAR_CAP_HIGH.
    If a particular color bar cap option is not specified then no cap
    will be drawn for that end. As a special case for
    PL_COLORBAR_SHADE, the option PL_COLORBAR_SHADE_LABEL can be
    specified. If this option is provided then any tick marks and tick
    labels will be placed at the breaks between shaded segments. TODO:
    This should be expanded to support custom placement of tick marks
    and tick labels at custom value locations for any color bar type.

    position (PLINT, input) :     position contains bits which control the
    overall position of the color bar and the definition of the
    adopted coordinates used for positions just like what is done for
    the position argument for pllegend. However, note that the
    defaults for the position bits (see below) are different than the
    pllegend case. The combination of the PL_POSITION_LEFT,
    PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, PL_POSITION_BOTTOM,
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE, and PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bits specifies one of
    the 16 possible standard positions (the 4 corners and centers of
    the 4 sides for both the inside and outside cases) of the color
    bar relative to the adopted coordinate system. The corner
    positions are specified by the appropriate combination of two of
    the PL_POSITION_LEFT, PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, and
    PL_POSITION_BOTTOM bits while the sides are specified by a single
    value of one of those bits.  The adopted coordinates are
    normalized viewport coordinates if the PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT bit is
    set or normalized subpage coordinates if the PL_POSITION_SUBPAGE
    bit is set. Default position bits: If none of PL_POSITION_LEFT,
    PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, or PL_POSITION_BOTTOM are set,
    then use PL_POSITION_RIGHT. If neither of PL_POSITION_INSIDE or
    PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE is set, use PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE. If neither of
    PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT or PL_POSITION_SUBPAGE is set, use
    PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT.

    x (PLFLT, input) :      X offset of the color bar position in adopted
    coordinates from the specified standard position of the color bar.
    For positive x, the direction of motion away from the standard
    position is inward/outward from the standard corner positions or
    standard left or right positions if the
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE/PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bit is set in position.
    For the standard top or bottom positions, the direction of motion
    is toward positive X.

    y (PLFLT, input) :      Y offset of the color bar position in adopted
    coordinates from the specified standard position of the color bar.
    For positive y, the direction of motion away from the standard
    position is inward/outward from the standard corner positions or
    standard top or bottom positions if the
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE/PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bit is set in position.
    For the standard left or right positions, the direction of motion
    is toward positive Y.

    x_length (PLFLT, input) :     Length of the body of the color bar in
    the X direction in adopted coordinates.

    y_length (PLFLT, input) :     Length of the body of the color bar in
    the Y direction in adopted coordinates.

    bg_color (PLINT, input) :     The cmap0 color of the background for the
    color bar (PL_COLORBAR_BACKGROUND).

    bb_color (PLINT, input) :     The cmap0 color of the bounding-box line
    for the color bar (PL_COLORBAR_BOUNDING_BOX).

    bb_style (PLINT, input) :     The pllsty style number for the
    bounding-box line for the color bar (PL_COLORBAR_BACKGROUND).

    low_cap_color (PLFLT, input) :    The cmap1 color of the low-end color
    bar cap, if it is drawn (PL_COLORBAR_CAP_LOW).

    high_cap_color (PLFLT, input) :    The cmap1 color of the high-end
    color bar cap, if it is drawn (PL_COLORBAR_CAP_HIGH).

    cont_color (PLINT, input) :    The cmap0 contour color for
    PL_COLORBAR_SHADE plots. This is passed directly to plshades, so
    it will be interpreted according to the design of plshades.

    cont_width (PLFLT, input) :    Contour width for PL_COLORBAR_SHADE
    plots. This is passed directly to plshades, so it will be
    interpreted according to the design of plshades.

    n_labels (PLINT, input) :     Number of labels to place around the
    color bar.

    label_opts (PLINT_VECTOR, input) :      A vector of options for each of
    n_labels labels.

    labels (PLCHAR_MATRIX, input) :    A vector of
    n_labels UTF-8 character strings containing the labels for the color
    bar.  Ignored if no label position is specified with one of the
    PL_COLORBAR_LABEL_RIGHT, PL_COLORBAR_LABEL_TOP,
    PL_COLORBAR_LABEL_LEFT, or PL_COLORBAR_LABEL_BOTTOM bits in the
    corresponding label_opts field.

    n_axes (PLINT, input) :    Number of axis definitions provided. This
    value must be greater than 0. It is typically 1 (numerical axis
    labels are provided for one of the long edges of the color bar),
    but it can be larger if multiple numerical axis labels for the
    long edges of the color bar are desired.

    axis_opts (PLCHAR_MATRIX, input) :      A vector of
    n_axes ascii character strings containing options (interpreted as for
    plbox) for the color bar's axis definitions.

    ticks (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :    A vector of n_axes values of the
    spacing of the major tick marks (interpreted as for plbox) for the
    color bar's axis definitions.

    sub_ticks (PLINT_VECTOR, input) :     A vector of n_axes values of the
    number of subticks (interpreted as for plbox) for the color bar's
    axis definitions.

    n_values (PLINT_VECTOR, input) :    A vector containing the number of
    elements in each of the n_axes rows of the values matrix.

    values (PLFLT_MATRIX, input) :    A matrix containing the numeric
    values for the data range represented by the color bar. For a row
    index of i_axis (where 0 < i_axis < n_axes), the number of
    elements in the row is specified by n_values[i_axis]. For
    PL_COLORBAR_IMAGE and PL_COLORBAR_GRADIENT the number of elements
    is 2, and the corresponding row elements of the values matrix are
    the minimum and maximum value represented by the colorbar.  For
    PL_COLORBAR_SHADE, the number and values of the elements of a row
    of the values matrix is interpreted the same as the nlevel and
    clevel arguments of plshades.

%feature( "docstring", "Configure the transformation between continuous and broken-down time for the current stream

DESCRIPTION:

    Configure the transformation between continuous and broken-down time
    for the current stream.  This transformation is used by both plbtime
    and plctime.

    Redacted form: General: plconfigtime(scale, offset1, offset2,
    ccontrol, ifbtime_offset, year, month, day, hour, min, sec)
	    Perl/PDL: Not available?


    This function is used in example 29.



SYNOPSIS:

plconfigtime(scale, offset1, offset2, ccontrol, ifbtime_offset, year, month, day, hour, min, sec)

ARGUMENTS:

    scale (PLFLT, input) :    The number of days per continuous time unit.
     As a special case, if
    scale is 0., then all other arguments are ignored, and the result (the
    default used by PLplot) is the equivalent of a call to
    plconfigtime(1./86400., 0., 0., 0x0, 1, 1970, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0.).
    That is, for this special case broken-down time is calculated with
    the proleptic Gregorian calendar with no leap seconds inserted,
    and the continuous time is defined as the number of seconds since
    the Unix epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

    offset1 (PLFLT, input) :    If
    ifbtime_offset is true, the parameters
    offset1 and
    offset2 are completely ignored. Otherwise, the sum of these parameters
    (with units in days) specify the epoch of the continuous time
    relative to the MJD epoch corresponding to the Gregorian calendar
    date of 1858-11-17T00:00:00Z or JD = 2400000.5.  Two PLFLT numbers
    are used to specify the origin to allow users (by specifying
    offset1 as an integer that can be exactly represented by a
    floating-point variable and specifying
    offset2 as a number in the range from 0. to 1) the chance to minimize
    the numerical errors of the continuous time representation.

    offset2 (PLFLT, input) :    See documentation of
    offset1.

    ccontrol (PLINT, input) :     ccontrol contains bits controlling the
    transformation.  If the 0x1 bit is set, then the proleptic Julian
    calendar is used for broken-down time rather than the proleptic
    Gregorian calendar.  If the 0x2 bit is set, then leap seconds that
    have been historically used to define UTC are inserted into the
    broken-down time. Other possibilities for additional control bits
    for ccontrol exist such as making the historical time corrections
    in the broken-down time corresponding to ET (ephemeris time) or
    making the (slightly non-constant) corrections from international
    atomic time (TAI) to what astronomers define as terrestrial time
    (TT).  But those additional possibilities have not been
    implemented yet in the qsastime library (one of the PLplot utility
    libraries).

    ifbtime_offset (PLBOOL, input) :    ifbtime_offset controls how the
    epoch of the continuous time scale is specified by the user. If
    ifbtime_offset is false, then
    offset1 and
    offset2 are used to specify the epoch, and the following broken-down
    time parameters are completely ignored.  If
    ifbtime_offset is true, then
    offset1 and
    offset2 are completely ignored, and the following broken-down time
    parameters are used to specify the epoch.

    year (PLINT, input) :    Year of epoch.

    month (PLINT, input) :    Month of epoch in range from 0 (January) to
    11 (December).

    day (PLINT, input) :    Day of epoch in range from 1 to 31.

    hour (PLINT, input) :    Hour of epoch in range from 0 to 23

    min (PLINT, input) :    Minute of epoch in range from 0 to 59.

    sec (PLFLT, input) :    Second of epoch in range from 0. to 60.

%feature( "docstring", "Contour plot

DESCRIPTION:

    Draws a contour plot of the data in f[
    nx][
    ny], using the nlevel contour levels specified by clevel. Only the
    region of the matrix from kx to lx and from ky to ly is plotted out
    where all these index ranges are interpreted as one-based for
    historical reasons.  A transformation routine pointed to by pltr with
    a generic pointer pltr_data for additional data required by the
    transformation routine is used to map indices within the matrix to the
    world coordinates.

    Redacted form: plcont(f, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, pltr, pltr_data)
    where (see above discussion) the pltr, pltr_data callback arguments
    are sometimes replaced by a tr vector with 6 elements; xg and yg
    vectors; or xg and yg matrices.

    This function is used in examples 9, 14, 16, and 22.



SYNOPSIS:

plcont(f, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, pltr, pltr_data)

ARGUMENTS:

    f (PLFLT_MATRIX, input) :     A matrix containing data to be contoured.

    nx, ny (PLINT, input) :    The dimensions of the matrix f.

    kx, lx (PLINT, input) :    Range of x indices to consider where 0 <=
    kx-1 < lx-1 < nx.  Values of kx and lx are one-based rather than
    zero-based for historical backwards-compatibility reasons.

    ky, ly (PLINT, input) :    Range of y indices to consider where 0 <=
    ky-1 < ly-1 < ny.  Values of ky and ly are one-based rather than
    zero-based for historical backwards-compatibility reasons.

    clevel (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :    A vector specifying the levels at
    which to draw contours.

    nlevel (PLINT, input) :    Number of contour levels to draw.

    pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback, input) :    A callback function that
    defines the transformation between the zero-based indices of the
    matrix f and the world coordinates.For the C case, transformation
    functions are provided in the PLplot library: pltr0 for the
    identity mapping, and pltr1 and pltr2 for arbitrary mappings
    respectively defined by vectors and matrices.  In addition, C
    callback routines for the transformation can be supplied by the
    user such as the mypltr function in examples/c/x09c.c which
    provides a general linear transformation between index coordinates
    and world coordinates.For languages other than C you should
    consult the PLplot documentation for the details concerning how
    PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments are interfaced. However, in
    general, a particular pattern of callback-associated arguments
    such as a tr vector with 6 elements; xg and yg vectors; or xg and
    yg matrices are respectively interfaced to a linear-transformation
    routine similar to the above mypltr function; pltr1; and pltr2.
    Furthermore, some of our more sophisticated bindings (see, e.g.,
    the PLplot documentation) support native language callbacks for
    handling index to world-coordinate transformations.  Examples of
    these various approaches are given in examples/<language>x09*,
    examples/<language>x16*, examples/<language>x20*,
    examples/<language>x21*, and examples/<language>x22*, for all our
    supported languages.

    pltr_data (PL_GENERIC_POINTER, input) :    Extra parameter to help
    pass information to pltr0, pltr1, pltr2, or whatever callback
    routine that is externally supplied.

    min, and sec. This function is the inverse of plbtime.

    The PLplot definition of broken-down time is a calendar time that
    completely ignores all time zone offsets, i.e., it is the user's
    responsibility to apply those offsets (if so desired) before using the
    PLplot time API.  By default broken-down time is defined using the
    proleptic Gregorian calendar without the insertion of leap seconds and
    continuous time is defined as the number of seconds since the Unix
    epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. However, other definitions of

%feature( "docstring", "Set up standard window and draw box

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets up plotter environment for simple graphs by calling pladv and
    setting up viewport and window to sensible default values. plenv
    leaves a standard margin (left-hand margin of eight character heights,
    and a margin around the other three sides of five character heights)
    around most graphs for axis labels and a title.  When these defaults
    are not suitable, use the individual routines plvpas, plvpor, or
    plvasp for setting up the viewport, plwind for defining the window,
    and plbox for drawing the box.

    Redacted form: plenv(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, just, axis)

    This function is used in example 1,3,9,13,14,19-22,29.

    system.  The origin of the gradient vector can be interpreted as being
    anywhere on the line corresponding to the minimum x value for the
    vertices in the rotated coordinate system.	The distance along the
    gradient vector is linearly transformed to the independent variable of
    color map 1 which ranges from 0. at the tail of the gradient vector to

DESCRIPTION:

    Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but PLplot 3D plots
    require data organized as a grid, i.e., with x sample point values
    independent of y coordinate and vice versa.  This function takes
    irregularly sampled data from the x[npts], y[npts], and z[npts]
    vectors; reads the desired grid location from the input vectors
    xg[nptsx] and yg[nptsy]; and returns the interpolated result on that
    grid using the output matrix zg[nptsx][nptsy].  The algorithm used to
    interpolate the data to the grid is specified with the argument type
    which can have one parameter specified in argument data.

    y (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :     The input y vector.

    z (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :     The input z vector. Each triple x[i],
    y[i], z[i] represents one data sample coordinate.

    npts (PLINT, input) :    The number of data samples in the x, y and z
    vectors.

    xg (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :      A vector that specifies the grid spacing
    in the x direction. Usually xg has nptsx equally spaced values
    from the minimum to the maximum values of the x input vector.

    nptsx (PLINT, input) :    The number of points in the xg vector.

    yg (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :      A vector that specifies the grid spacing
    in the y direction. Similar to the xg parameter.

    nptsy (PLINT, input) :    The number of points in the yg vector.

    zg (PLFLT_NC_MATRIX, output) :    The matrix of interpolated results
    where data lies in the grid specified by xg and yg. Therefore the
    zg matrix must be dimensioned
    nptsx by
    nptsy.

    type (PLINT, input) :    The type of grid interpolation algorithm to
    use, which can be: GRID_CSA: Bivariate Cubic Spline approximation

    For details of the algorithms read the source file plgridd.c.

    data (PLFLT, input) :    Some gridding algorithms require extra data,
    which can be specified through this argument. Currently, for
    algorithm: GRID_NNIDW, data specifies the number of neighbors to
    use, the lower the value, the noisier (more local) the
    approximation is.
        GRID_NNLI, data specifies what a thin triangle is, in the
        range [1. .. 2.]. High values enable the usage of very thin
        triangles for interpolation, possibly resulting in error in
        the approximation.
        GRID_NNI, only weights greater than data will be accepted. If
        0, all weights will be accepted.

    Data between valuemin and valuemax map linearly to colors in the

    pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback, input) :    A callback function that
    defines the transformation between the zero-based indices of the
    matrix idata and world coordinates. If
    pltr is not supplied (e.g., is set to NULL in the C case), then the x
    indices of idata are mapped to the range
    xmin through
    xmax and the y indices of idata are mapped to the range
    ymin through
    ymax.For the C case, transformation functions are provided in the
    PLplot library: pltr0 for the identity mapping, and pltr1 and
    pltr2 for arbitrary mappings respectively defined by vectors and
    matrices.  In addition, C callback routines for the transformation
    can be supplied by the user such as the mypltr function in
    examples/c/x09c.c which provides a general linear transformation
    between index coordinates and world coordinates.For languages
    other than C you should consult the PLplot documentation for the
    details concerning how PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments are
    interfaced. However, in general, a particular pattern of
    callback-associated arguments such as a tr vector with 6 elements;
    xg and yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices are respectively
    interfaced to a linear-transformation routine similar to the above
    mypltr function; pltr1; and pltr2. Furthermore, some of our more
    sophisticated bindings (see, e.g., the PLplot documentation)
    support native language callbacks for handling index to

    keyword or number of the desired output device.  Hitting a RETURN in
    response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device.
    plinit will issue no prompt if either the device was specified
    previously (via command line flag, the plsetopt function, or the
    plsdev function), or if only one device is enabled when PLplot is
    installed.	If subpages have been specified, the output device is
    divided into nx by ny subpages, each of which may be used
    independently.  If plinit is called again during a program, the
    previously opened file will be closed.  The subroutine pladv is used
    to advance from one subpage to the next.

    Redacted form: plinit()

    This function is used in all of the examples.

DESCRIPTION:

    Routine for creating a discrete plot legend with a plotted filled box,
    line, and/or line of symbols for each annotated legend entry.  (See
    plcolorbar for similar functionality for creating continuous color
    bars.)  The arguments of pllegend provide control over the location
    and size of the legend as well as the location and characteristics of
    the elements (most of which are optional) within that legend.  The
    resulting legend is clipped at the boundaries of the current subpage.
    (N.B. the adopted coordinate system used for some of the parameters is
    defined in the documentation of the position parameter.)

    box_scales, box_line_widths, line_colors, line_styles, line_widths,
    symbol_colors, symbol_scales, symbol_numbers, symbols)

    This function is used in examples 4, 26, and 33.



SYNOPSIS:

pllegend(p_legend_width, p_legend_height, opt, position, x, y, plot_width, bg_color, bb_color, bb_style, nrow, ncolumn, nlegend, opt_array, text_offset, text_scale, text_spacing, test_justification, text_colors, text, box_colors, box_patterns, box_scales, box_line_widths, line_colors, line_styles, line_widths, symbol_colors, symbol_scales, symbol_numbers, symbols)

ARGUMENTS:

    p_legend_width (PLFLT_NC_SCALAR, output) :      Returned value of the
    legend width in adopted coordinates. This quantity is calculated
    from plot_width, text_offset, ncolumn (possibly modified inside
    the routine depending on nlegend and nrow), and the length
    (calculated internally) of the longest text string.

    p_legend_height (PLFLT_NC_SCALAR, output) :    Returned value of the
    legend height in adopted coordinates. This quantity is calculated
    from text_scale, text_spacing, and nrow (possibly modified inside
    the routine depending on nlegend and nrow).

    opt (PLINT, input) :    opt contains bits controlling the overall
    legend. If the PL_LEGEND_TEXT_LEFT bit is set, put the text area
    on the left of the legend and the plotted area on the right.
    Otherwise, put the text area on the right of the legend and the
    plotted area on the left. If the PL_LEGEND_BACKGROUND bit is set,
    plot a (semitransparent) background for the legend. If the
    PL_LEGEND_BOUNDING_BOX bit is set, plot a bounding box for the
    legend. If the PL_LEGEND_ROW_MAJOR bit is set and (both of the
    possibly internally transformed) nrow > 1 and ncolumn > 1, then
    plot the resulting array of legend entries in row-major order.
    Otherwise, plot the legend entries in column-major order.

    position (PLINT, input) :     position contains bits which control the
    overall position of the legend and the definition of the adopted
    coordinates used for positions just like what is done for the
    position argument for plcolorbar. However, note that the defaults
    for the position bits (see below) are different than the
    plcolorbar case.  The combination of the PL_POSITION_LEFT,
    PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, PL_POSITION_BOTTOM,
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE, and PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bits specifies one of
    the 16 possible standard positions (the 4 corners and centers of
    the 4 sides for both the inside and outside cases) of the legend
    relative to the adopted coordinate system. The corner positions
    are specified by the appropriate combination of two of the
    PL_POSITION_LEFT, PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, and
    PL_POSITION_BOTTOM bits while the sides are specified by a single
    value of one of those bits.  The adopted coordinates are
    normalized viewport coordinates if the PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT bit is
    set or normalized subpage coordinates if the PL_POSITION_SUBPAGE
    bit is set. Default position bits: If none of PL_POSITION_LEFT,
    PL_POSITION_RIGHT, PL_POSITION_TOP, or PL_POSITION_BOTTOM are set,
    then use the combination of PL_POSITION_RIGHT and PL_POSITION_TOP.
    If neither of PL_POSITION_INSIDE or PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE is set,
    use PL_POSITION_INSIDE. If neither of PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT or
    PL_POSITION_SUBPAGE is set, use PL_POSITION_VIEWPORT.

    x (PLFLT, input) :      X offset of the legend position in adopted
    coordinates from the specified standard position of the legend.
    For positive x, the direction of motion away from the standard
    position is inward/outward from the standard corner positions or
    standard left or right positions if the
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE/PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bit is set in position.
    For the standard top or bottom positions, the direction of motion
    is toward positive X.

    y (PLFLT, input) :      Y offset of the legend position in adopted
    coordinates from the specified standard position of the legend.
    For positive y, the direction of motion away from the standard
    position is inward/outward from the standard corner positions or
    standard top or bottom positions if the
    PL_POSITION_INSIDE/PL_POSITION_OUTSIDE bit is set in position. For
    the standard left or right positions, the direction of motion is
    toward positive Y.

    plot_width (PLFLT, input) :    Horizontal width in adopted coordinates
    of the plot area (where the colored boxes, lines, and/or lines of
    symbols are drawn) of the legend.

    bg_color (PLINT, input) :     The cmap0 color of the background for the
    legend (PL_LEGEND_BACKGROUND).

    bb_color (PLINT, input) :     The cmap0 color of the bounding-box line
    for the legend (PL_LEGEND_BOUNDING_BOX).

    bb_style (PLINT, input) :     The pllsty style number for the
    bounding-box line for the legend (PL_LEGEND_BACKGROUND).

    nrow (PLINT, input) :    The cmap0 index of the background color for
    the legend (PL_LEGEND_BACKGROUND).

    ncolumn (PLINT, input) :    The cmap0 index of the background color
    for the legend (PL_LEGEND_BACKGROUND).

    nlegend (PLINT, input) :    Number of legend entries.  N.B.  The total
    vertical height of the legend in adopted coordinates is calculated
    internally from nlegend, text_scale (see below), and text_spacing
    (see below).

    opt_array (PLINT_VECTOR, input) :     A vector of
    nlegend values of options to control each individual plotted area
    corresponding to a legend entry.  If the
    PL_LEGEND_NONE bit is set, then nothing is plotted in the plotted
    area.  If the
    PL_LEGEND_COLOR_BOX,
    PL_LEGEND_LINE, and/or
    PL_LEGEND_SYMBOL bits are set, the area corresponding to a legend
    entry is plotted with a colored box; a line; and/or a line of
    symbols.

    text_offset (PLFLT, input) :    Offset of the text area from the plot
    area in units of character width.  N.B.  The total horizontal
    width of the legend in adopted coordinates is calculated
    internally from
    plot_width (see above),
    text_offset, and length (calculated internally) of the longest text
    string.

    text_scale (PLFLT, input) :    Character height scale for text
    annotations.  N.B.  The total vertical height of the legend in
    adopted coordinates is calculated internally from
    nlegend (see above),
    text_scale, and
    text_spacing (see below).

    text_spacing (PLFLT, input) :    Vertical spacing in units of the
    character height from one legend entry to the next.  N.B.  The
    total vertical height of the legend in adopted coordinates is
    calculated internally from
    nlegend (see above),
    text_scale (see above), and
    text_spacing.

    text_justification (PLFLT, input) :    Justification parameter used
    for text justification.  The most common values of
    text_justification are 0., 0.5, or 1. corresponding to a text that
    is left justified, centred, or right justified within the text
    area, but other values are allowed as well.

    text_colors (PLINT_VECTOR, input) :    A vector containing
    nlegend cmap0 text colors.

    text (PLCHAR_MATRIX, input) :    A vector of
    nlegend UTF-8 character strings containing the legend annotations.

DESCRIPTION:

    Plots continental outlines or shapefile data in world coordinates. A
    demonstration of how to use this function to create different
    projections can be found in examples/c/x19c. PLplot is provided with
    basic coastal outlines and USA state borders. These can be used
    irrespective of whether Shapefile support is built into PLplot. With
    Shapefile support this function can also be used with user Shapefiles,
    in which case it will plot the entire contents of a Shapefile joining
    each point of each Shapefile element with a line. Shapefiles have
    become a popular standard for geographical data and data in this
    format can be easily found from a number of online sources. Shapefile
    data is actually provided as three or more files with the same
    filename, but different extensions. The .shp and .shx files are
    required for plotting Shapefile data with PLplot.

ARGUMENTS:

    mapform (PLMAPFORM_callback, input) :    A user supplied function to
    transform the original map data coordinates to a new coordinate
    system. The PLplot-supplied map data is provided as latitudes and
    longitudes; other Shapefile data may be provided in other
    coordinate systems as can be found in their .prj plain text files.
    For example, by using this transform we can change from a
    longitude, latitude coordinate to a polar stereographic
    projection. Initially, x[0]..[n-1] are the original x coordinates
    (longitudes for the PLplot-supplied data) and y[0]..y[n-1] are the
    corresponding y coordinates (latitudes for the PLplot supplied
    data).    After the call to mapform(), x[] and y[] should be
    replaced by the corresponding plot coordinates. If no transform is
    desired, mapform can be replaced by NULL.

    name (PLCHAR_VECTOR, input) :    An ascii character string specifying
    the type of map plotted. This is either one of the PLplot built-in
    maps or the file name of a set of Shapefile files without the file
    extensions. For the PLplot built-in maps the possible values are:
    \"globe\" -- continental outlines
        \"usa\" -- USA and state boundaries
        \"cglobe\" -- continental outlines and countries
        \"usaglobe\" -- USA, state boundaries and continental outlines


    minx (PLFLT, input) :    The minimum x value of map elements to be
    drawn. For the built in maps this is a measure of longitude. For
    Shapefiles the units must match the projection. The value of minx
    must be less than the value of maxx. Specifying a useful limit for
    these limits provides a useful optimization for complex or
    detailed maps.

    maxx (PLFLT, input) :    The maximum x value of map elements to be
    drawn

    miny (PLFLT, input) :    The minimum y value of map elements to be

    be in the same units as used by the Shapefile. You could use a
    very large negative number to plot everything, but you can improve
    performance by limiting the area drawn. The units must match those
    of the Shapefile projection, which may be for example longitude or
    distance. The value of minx must be less than the value of maxx.

%feature( "docstring", "Draw a polygon in 3 space

DESCRIPTION:

    Draws a polygon in 3 space defined by n points in x, y, and z. Setup
    like plline3, but differs from that function in that plpoly3 attempts
    to determine if the polygon is viewable depending on the order of the
    points within the vector and the value of ifcc.  If the back of
    polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.	If this isn't what
    you want, then use plline3 instead.

    The points are assumed to be in a plane, and the directionality of the
    plane is determined from the first three points.  Additional points do
    not have to lie on the plane defined by the first three, but if they
    do not, then the determination of visibility obviously can't be 100%
    accurate... So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar,
    consider breaking them into smaller polygons.  3 points define a plane
    :-).

    Bugs:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if they
    are co-linear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance of
    being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).	See x18c.c for an example
    of this problem. (Search for 20.1).

    draw (PLBOOL_VECTOR, input) :    A vector containing

%feature( "docstring", "Set cmap1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship

DESCRIPTION:

    Set cmap1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between the
    cmap1 intensity index (0.0-1.0) and position in HLS or RGB color space
    (see the PLplot documentation).  May be called at any time.

    The idea here is to specify a number of control points that define the
    mapping between input cmap1 intensity indices and HLS (or RGB).
    Between these points, linear interpolation is used which gives a
    smooth variation of color with intensity index.  Any number of control
    points may be specified, located at arbitrary positions, although
    typically 2 - 4 are enough. Another way of stating this is that we are
    traversing a given number of lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we
    move through cmap1 intensity indices.  The control points at the
    minimum and maximum position (0 and 1) must always be specified.  By
    adding more control points you can get more variation.  One good
    technique for plotting functions that vary about some expected average
    is to use an additional 2 control points in the center (position ~=
    0.5) that are the same lightness as the background (typically white
    for paper output, black for crt), and same hue as the boundary control
    points.  This allows the highs and lows to be very easily
    distinguished.

    Each control point must specify the cmap1 intensity index and the
    associated three coordinates in HLS or RGB space.  The first point
    must correspond to position = 0, and the last to position = 1.

    The default behaviour is for the hue to be linearly interpolated
    between the control points. Since the hue lies in the range [0, 360]
    this corresponds to interpolation around the \"front\" of the color
    wheel (red<->green<->blue<->red). If alt_hue_path[i] is true, then an
    alternative interpolation is used between control points i and i+1. If
    hue[i+1]-hue[i] > 0 then interpolation is between hue[i] and hue[i+1]
    - 360, otherwise between hue[i] and hue[i+1] + 360. You can consider
    this as interpolation around the \"back\" or \"reverse\" of the color
    wheel. Specifying alt_hue_path=NULL is equivalent to setting
    alt_hue_path[] = false for every control point.

    Shade regions on the basis of value.  This is the high-level routine
    for making continuous color shaded plots with cmap1 while plshade
    should be used to plot individual shaded regions using either cmap0 or
    cmap1. examples/;<language>/x16* shows how to use plshades for each of
    our supported languages.

    Redacted form: General: plshades(a, defined, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax,
    clevel, fill_width, cont_color, cont_width, fill, rectangular, pltr,
    pltr_data)
	    Perl/PDL: plshades(a, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, clevel,
    fill_width, cont_color, cont_width, fill, rectangular, defined, pltr,
    pltr_data)


    This function is used in examples 16, 21, and 22.



SYNOPSIS:

plshades(a, nx, ny, defined, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, clevel, nlevel, fill_width, cont_color, cont_width, fill, rectangular, pltr, pltr_data)

ARGUMENTS:

    a (PLFLT_MATRIX, input) :     A matrix containing function values to
    plot.  Should have dimensions of
    nx by
    ny.

    nx (PLINT, input) :    First dimension of matrix \"a\".

    ny (PLINT, input) :    Second dimension of matrix \"a\".

    defined (PLDEFINED_callback, input) :    Callback function specifying
    the region that should be plotted in the shade plot.  This
    function accepts x and y coordinates as input arguments and must
    return 1 if the point is to be included in the shade plot and 0
    otherwise.  If you want to plot the entire shade plot (the usual
    case), this argument should be set to NULL.

    xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax (PLFLT, input) :    See the discussion of
    pltr below for how these arguments are used (only for the special case
    when the callback function
    pltr is not supplied).

    clevel (PLFLT_VECTOR, input) :    A vector containing the data levels
    corresponding to the edges of each shaded region that will be
    plotted by this function.  To work properly the levels should be
    monotonic.

    nlevel (PLINT, input) :    Number of shades plus 1 (i.e., the number
    of shade edge values in clevel).

    fill_width (PLFLT, input) :    Defines the line width used by the fill
    pattern.

    cont_color (PLINT, input) :    Defines cmap0 pen color used for
    contours defining edges of shaded regions.  The pen color is only
    temporary set for the contour drawing.    Set this value to zero or
    less if no shade edge contours are wanted.

    cont_width (PLFLT, input) :    Defines line width used for contours
    defining edges of shaded regions.  This value may not be honored
    by all drivers. The pen width is only temporary set for the
    contour drawing.  Set this value to zero or less if no shade edge
    contours are wanted.

    fill (PLFILL_callback, input) :    Callback routine used to fill the
    region.  Use plfill for this purpose.

    rectangular (PLBOOL, input) :    Set rectangular to true if rectangles
    map to rectangles after coordinate transformation with pltrl.
    Otherwise, set rectangular to false. If rectangular is set to
    true, plshade tries to save time by filling large rectangles.
    This optimization fails if the coordinate transformation distorts
    the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polar coordinates
    has to have rectangular set to false.

    pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback, input) :    A callback function that
    defines the transformation between the zero-based indices of the
    matrix a and world coordinates. If
    pltr is not supplied (e.g., is set to NULL in the C case), then the x
    indices of a are mapped to the range
    xmin through
    xmax and the y indices of a are mapped to the range
    ymin through
    ymax.For the C case, transformation functions are provided in the
    PLplot library: pltr0 for the identity mapping, and pltr1 and
    pltr2 for arbitrary mappings respectively defined by vectors and
    matrices.  In addition, C callback routines for the transformation
    can be supplied by the user such as the mypltr function in
    examples/c/x09c.c which provides a general linear transformation
    between index coordinates and world coordinates.For languages
    other than C you should consult the PLplot documentation for the
    details concerning how PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments are
    interfaced. However, in general, a particular pattern of
    callback-associated arguments such as a tr vector with 6 elements;
    xg and yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices are respectively
    interfaced to a linear-transformation routine similar to the above
    mypltr function; pltr1; and pltr2. Furthermore, some of our more
    sophisticated bindings (see, e.g., the PLplot documentation)
    support native language callbacks for handling index to
    world-coordinate transformations.  Examples of these various
    approaches are given in examples/<language>x09*,
    examples/<language>x16*, examples/<language>x20*,
    examples/<language>x21*, and examples/<language>x22*, for all our
    supported languages.

    pltr_data (PL_GENERIC_POINTER, input) :    Extra parameter to help
    pass information to pltr0, pltr1, pltr2, or whatever routine that
    is externally supplied.

%feature( "docstring", "Shade individual region on the basis of value

DESCRIPTION:

    Shade individual region on the basis of value.  Use plshades if you
    want to shade a number of contiguous regions using continuous colors.
    In particular the edge contours are treated properly in plshades.  If
    you attempt to do contiguous regions with plshade the contours at the
    edge of the shade are partially obliterated by subsequent plots of
    contiguous shaded regions.

    Redacted form: General: plshade(a, defined, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax,
    shade_min, shade_max, sh_cmap, sh_color, sh_width, min_color,
    min_width, max_color, max_width, fill, rectangular, pltr, pltr_data)


    This function is used in example 15.



SYNOPSIS:

plshade(a, nx, ny, defined, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, shade_min, shade_max, sh_cmap, sh_color, sh_width, min_color, min_width, max_color, max_width, fill, rectangular, pltr, pltr_data)

ARGUMENTS:

    a (PLFLT_MATRIX, input) :     A matrix containing function values to
    plot.  Should have dimensions of
    nx by
    ny.

    nx (PLINT, input) :    First dimension of the matrix \"a\".

    ny (PLINT, input) :    Second dimension of the matrix \"a\".

    defined (PLDEFINED_callback, input) :    Callback function specifying
    the region that should be plotted in the shade plot.  This
    function accepts x and y coordinates as input arguments and must
    return 1 if the point is to be included in the shade plot and 0
    otherwise.  If you want to plot the entire shade plot (the usual
    case), this argument should be set to NULL.

    xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax (PLFLT, input) :    See the discussion of
    pltr below for how these arguments are used (only for the special case
    when the callback function
    pltr is not supplied).

    shade_min (PLFLT, input) :      Defines the lower end of the interval to
    be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade does nothing.

    shade_max (PLFLT, input) :      Defines the upper end of the interval to
    be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade does nothing.

    sh_cmap (PLINT, input) :    Defines color map. If sh_cmap=0, then
    sh_color is interpreted as a cmap0 (integer) index.  If sh_cmap=1,
    then sh_color is interpreted as a cmap1 argument in the range
    (0.0-1.0).

    sh_color (PLFLT, input) :     Defines color map index with integer
    value if cmap0 or value in range (0.0-1.0) if cmap1.

    sh_width (PLFLT, input) :     Defines width used by the fill pattern.

    min_color (PLINT, input) :      Defines pen color, width used by the
    boundary of shaded region. The min values are used for the
    shade_min boundary, and the max values are used on the shade_max
    boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted boundaries.

    min_width (PLFLT, input) :      Defines pen color, width used by the
    boundary of shaded region. The min values are used for the
    shade_min boundary, and the max values are used on the shade_max
    boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted boundaries.

    max_color (PLINT, input) :      Defines pen color, width used by the
    boundary of shaded region. The min values are used for the
    shade_min boundary, and the max values are used on the shade_max
    boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted boundaries.

    max_width (PLFLT, input) :      Defines pen color, width used by the
    boundary of shaded region. The min values are used for the
    shade_min boundary, and the max values are used on the shade_max
    boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted boundaries.

    fill (PLFILL_callback, input) :    Routine used to fill the region.
    Use plfill.  Future version of PLplot may have other fill
    routines.

    rectangular (PLBOOL, input) :    Set rectangular to true if rectangles
    map to rectangles after coordinate transformation with pltrl.
    Otherwise, set rectangular to false. If rectangular is set to
    true, plshade tries to save time by filling large rectangles.
    This optimization fails if the coordinate transformation distorts
    the shape of rectangles. For example a plot in polar coordinates
    has to have rectangular set to false.

    pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback, input) :    A callback function that

%feature( "docstring", "Set page parameters

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets the page configuration (optional).  If an individual parameter is
    zero then that parameter value is not updated.  Not all parameters are
    recognized by all drivers and the interpretation is device-dependent.
    The X-window driver uses the length and offset parameters to determine
    the window size and location.  The length and offset values are
    expressed in units that are specific to the current driver.  For
    instance: screen drivers will usually interpret them as number of
    pixels, whereas printer drivers will usually use mm.

    This routine, if used, must be called before initializing PLplot.  It
    may be called at later times for interactive drivers to change only
    the dpi for subsequent redraws which you can force via a call to
    plreplot.  If this function is not called then the page size defaults
    to landscape A4 for drivers which use real world page sizes and 744
    pixels wide by 538 pixels high for raster drivers. The default value
    for dx and dy is 90 pixels per inch for raster drivers.

     provided by system strftime routines are the following: %(0-9):
     The fractional part of the seconds field (including leading
     decimal point) to the specified accuracy. Thus %S%3 would give
     seconds to millisecond accuracy (00.000).
        %.: The fractional part of the seconds field (including
        leading decimal point) to the maximum available accuracy. Thus
        %S%. would give seconds with fractional part up to 9 decimal
        places if available.

%feature( "docstring", "Vector plot

DESCRIPTION:

    Draws a plot of vector data contained in the matrices (
    u[
    nx][
    ny],
    v[
    nx][
    ny]) . The scaling factor for the vectors is given by scale. A
    transformation routine pointed to by pltr with a pointer pltr_data for
    additional data required by the transformation routine to map indices
    within the matrices to the world coordinates. The style of the vector
    arrow may be set using plsvect.

    Redacted form: plvect(u, v, scale, pltr, pltr_data) where (see above
    discussion) the pltr, pltr_data callback arguments are sometimes
    replaced by a tr vector with 6 elements, or xg and yg array arguments
    with either one or two dimensions.

    This function is used in example 22.



SYNOPSIS:

plvect(u, v, nx, ny, scale, pltr, pltr_data)

ARGUMENTS:

    u, v (PLFLT_MATRIX, input) :    A pair of matrices containing the x
    and y components of the vector data to be plotted.

    nx, ny (PLINT, input) :    Dimensions of the matrices u and v.

    scale (PLFLT, input) :    Parameter to control the scaling factor of
    the vectors for plotting. If scale = 0    then the scaling factor is
    automatically calculated for the data. If scale < 0 then the
    scaling factor is automatically calculated for the data and then
    multiplied by -
    scale. If scale > 0 then the scaling factor is set to scale.

    pltr (PLTRANSFORM_callback, input) :    A callback function that
    defines the transformation between the zero-based indices of the
    matrices u and v and world coordinates.For the C case,
    transformation functions are provided in the PLplot library: pltr0
    for the identity mapping, and pltr1 and pltr2 for arbitrary
    mappings respectively defined by vectors and matrices.    In
    addition, C callback routines for the transformation can be
    supplied by the user such as the mypltr function in
    examples/c/x09c.c which provides a general linear transformation
    between index coordinates and world coordinates.For languages
    other than C you should consult the PLplot documentation for the
    details concerning how PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments are
    interfaced. However, in general, a particular pattern of
    callback-associated arguments such as a tr vector with 6 elements;
    xg and yg vectors; or xg and yg matrices are respectively
    interfaced to a linear-transformation routine similar to the above
    mypltr function; pltr1; and pltr2. Furthermore, some of our more
    sophisticated bindings (see, e.g., the PLplot documentation)
    support native language callbacks for handling index to
    world-coordinate transformations.  Examples of these various
    approaches are given in examples/<language>x09*,
    examples/<language>x16*, examples/<language>x20*,
    examples/<language>x21*, and examples/<language>x22*, for all our
    supported languages.

    pltr_data (PL_GENERIC_POINTER, input) :    Extra parameter to help
    pass information to pltr0, pltr1, pltr2, or whatever callback
    routine that is externally supplied.

%feature( "docstring", "Specify viewport using coordinates and aspect ratio

DESCRIPTION:

    Device-independent routine for setting up the viewport.  The viewport
    is chosen to be the largest with the given aspect ratio that fits
    within the specified region (in terms of normalized subpage
    coordinates).  This routine is functionally equivalent to plvpor when
    a ``natural'' aspect ratio (0.0) is chosen.  Unlike plvasp, this
    routine reserves no extra space at the edges for labels.

%feature( "docstring", "Configure the transformations required for projecting a 3D surface on a 2D window

DESCRIPTION:

    Configure the transformations required for projecting a 3D surface on
    an existing 2D window.  Those transformations (see the PLplot
    documentation) are done to a rectangular cuboid enclosing the 3D
    surface which has its limits expressed in 3D world coordinates and
    also normalized 3D coordinates (used for interpreting the altitude and
    azimuth of the viewing angle).  The transformations consist of the
    linear transform from 3D world coordinates to normalized 3D
    coordinates, and the 3D rotation of normalized coordinates required to
    align the pole of the new 3D coordinate system with the viewing
    direction specified by altitude and azimuth so that x and y of the
    surface elements in that transformed coordinate system are the
    projection of the 3D surface with given viewing direction on the 2D
    window.

    The enclosing rectangular cuboid for the surface plot is defined by
    xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin and zmax in 3D world coordinates.  It is
    mapped into the same rectangular cuboid with normalized 3D coordinate
    sizes of basex by basey by height so that xmin maps to -
    basex/2, xmax maps to basex/2, ymin maps to -
    basey/2, ymax maps to basey/2, zmin maps to 0 and zmax maps to height.
     The resulting rectangular cuboid in normalized coordinates is then
    viewed by an observer at altitude alt and azimuth az.  This routine
    must be called before plbox3 or any of the 3D surface plotting
    routines; plmesh, plmeshc, plot3d, plot3dc, plot3dcl, plsurf3d,
    plsurf3dl or plfill3.

    Redacted form: plw3d(basex, basey, height, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax,
    zmin, zmax, alt, az)

    This function is examples 8, 11, 18, and 21.



SYNOPSIS:

plw3d(basex, basey, height, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, alt, az)

ARGUMENTS:

    basex (PLFLT, input) :    The normalized x coordinate size of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    basey (PLFLT, input) :    The normalized y coordinate size of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    height (PLFLT, input) :    The normalized z coordinate size of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    xmin (PLFLT, input) :    The minimum x world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    xmax (PLFLT, input) :    The maximum x world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    ymin (PLFLT, input) :    The minimum y world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    ymax (PLFLT, input) :    The maximum y world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    zmin (PLFLT, input) :    The minimum z world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    zmax (PLFLT, input) :    The maximum z world coordinate of the
    rectangular cuboid.

    alt (PLFLT, input) :    The viewing altitude in degrees above the xy
    plane of the rectangular cuboid in normalized coordinates.

    az (PLFLT, input) :    The viewing azimuth in degrees of the
    rectangular cuboid in normalized coordinates.  When az=0, the
    observer is looking face onto the zx plane of the rectangular
    cuboid in normalized coordinates, and as az is increased, the
    observer moves clockwise around that cuboid when viewed from above
    the xy plane.
