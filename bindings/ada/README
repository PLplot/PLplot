Ada Bindings for the PLplot Plotting Package
 
1 About the This Document
          This document describes the Ada bindings to the PLplot
  technical plotting software, how to obtain the necessary software
  components, and how to use them together.
2 Overview
          The Ada bindings for PLplot provide a way for Ada programmers
  to access the powerful PLplot technical plotting facilities directly
  from Ada programs while working completely in Ada—the Ada programmer
  never needs to know or worry that PLplot itself is written in another
  language.
          There are a thin binding and two thick bindings provided. The
  thin binding presents the application programming interface (API) in
  a form very similar to the C API, although in 100% Ada. The thick
  bindings present the API in a form to which Ada programmers will be
  more accustomed and add some ease-of-use features. It is expected
  that the thick bindings will be preferred.
3 About PLplot
          PLplot is a general purpose technical plotting package that
  can be accessed directly by the user's own program without first
  writing the data to be plotted to disk. The package is marked by
  speed, convenience, breadth, and flexibility.
          The PLplot project is one of the most active on SourceForge,
  typically in the 99th percentile for activity.
          The following is taken from the PLplot web site at
  plplot.sourceforge.net <http://plplot.sourceforge.net/>:
         "PLplot is a library of functions that are useful for making
  scientific plots.
          "PLplot can be used from within compiled languages such as C,
  C++, FORTRAN and Java, and interactively from interpreted languages
  such as Octave, Python, Perl and Tcl.
          "The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots,
  semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh
  plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or
  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines
  in each graph.
          "A variety of output file devices such as Postscript, png,
  jpeg and others, as well as interactive devices such as xwin, tk,
  xterm and Tektronics devices are supported. New devices can be easily
  added by writing a small number of device dependent routines.
          "There are almost 2000 characters in the extended character
  set. This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a
  host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols. Some devices
  supports its own way of dealing with text, such as the Postscript
  driver, or the png and jpeg drivers that uses the Freetype library."
4 The Bindings
          The bindings are a re-expression and extension of the
  C-language API and as such are a kind of abstract layer between the
  user's code and the PLplot binary library. Additionally, there are a
  few capabilities not in the official API but nonetheless which are
  available to the C programmer which are included in the bindings and
  thus are directly available to the Ada programmer.
          The thin binding is a layer between the thick bindings and
  the underlying C code. It is mainly a programming convenience for the
  developer of the bindings; this is a common implementation for
  foreign language bindings and for the most part, the user can ignore
  it.
          There are two thick bindings provided for the convenience of
  the user. Either may be used and they both provide exactly the same
  functionality. The thick bindings are the user's main concern with
  programming for PLplot.
    4.1 Thin Binding
                The thin binding, in the files plplotthin.ads and
          plplotthin.adb, is mostly a direct and obvious mapping of the
          C application programming interface (API) to Ada. Thus, for
          example, where a C program such as plcol0 requires a single
          integer argument, there is a corresponding Ada program also
          called plcol0 which also requires a single integer argument.
          (plcol0 happens to set the drawing color using a number which
          is associated with a set of colors.) Various constants from
          the C API are also included here. Numeric types as defined in
          PLplot are associated with numeric types in Ada in the thin
          binding by use of Ada's type system. Thus, the thin binding
          refers to the PLplot-centric type PLFLT for floating-point
          types while the thick binding uses the usual Ada type
          Long_Float.
                Many of the comments from the C source header file
          (similar in purpose to an Ada specification file) have been
          retained in the thin binding, even when they are no longer
          sensical. These might be pruned at some point to facilitate
          reading the Ada source.
                Also included in the thin binding are some other
          declarations which help the Ada binding to mesh well with C
          by emulating certain data structures which are needed in some
          rather specialized usages as well as providing certain
          subprogram pointer types.
                The Ada programmer working with either of the thick
          bindings will have to refer to the thin binding relatively
          rarely, if ever, and mainly to examine the subroutine pointer
          declarations and the several variant record types which are
          used mostly for contour and three-dimensional plots. However,
          some of these have been subtype-ed or renames-ed in the thick
          bindings so even less reference to the thin binding will be
          necessary. The goal is to put everything of interest to the
          user in the thick bindings and the user need not with the
          thin binding.
    4.2 The Thick Bindings
                The thick bindings provide most of the information
          that the Ada programmer needs. Normally, only one of the two
          thick bindings would be used per user program but it should
          be possible to include both but that scenario would be
          unusual.
                There are three main aspects of the thick bindings:
          providing an alternative access to the PLplot API, extending
          the PLplot functionality with some easy-to-use features, and
          overlaying Ada data structures and types.
                In the first aspect, the thick bindings provide a
          fully Ada interface to the entire PLplot library. Packages
          are with-ed and use-d as normal Ada code. Ada arrays can be
          passed as usual, not requiring the array length or start or
          end indices to be passed separately. All necessary Ada types
          are made to match the underlying C types exactly.
                The second aspect of the thick bindings is to provide
          some simplified ways to get a lot of plotting done with only
          one or two subroutine calls. For example, a single call to
          Simple_Plot can display from one to five "y's" as a function
          of a single "x" with default plot appearances chosen to suit
          many situations. Other simple plotters are available for
          three-dimensional and contour plots. Manipulating PLplot's
          colors is similarly made easy and some default color schemes
          are provided.
                The third main aspect of the thick binding is to use
          Ada data structures and Ada's type system extensively to
          reduce the chances of inappropriate actions. For example, Ada
          arrays are used throughout (as opposed to C's
          pointer-plus-offset-while-carrying-along-the-size-separately
          approach). Quantities which have natural range limits are
          subtype-d to reflect those constraints. The hope is that
          program errors will result in more-familiar Ada compilation
          or run-time errors rather than error reports from the PLplot
          library or no reports at all. However, there remain a few
          instances where the typing could be improved and PLplot
          errors will still be reported from time to time.
                Both the specification and body for the standard
          thick (and thin) binding contain the C subroutine name as a
          comment line immediately above the Ada procedure declaration;
          this should help in making the associations between "Ada"
          names and "PLplot" names. Also, the subroutine-specific
          comments from the C API have been retained verbatim.
    4.3 Standard Thick Binding Using Enhanced Names
                The distinguishing feature of this thick binding (the
          "standard" binding) is to provide more descriptive names for
          PLplot subroutines, variables, constants, arguments, and
          other objects. Most Ada programmers will be more comfortable
          using these names. For example, in the C API as well as the
          thin Ada binding and the other thick Ada binding, the
          procedure plcol0(1) sets the drawing color to red. In the
          standard thick binding, the same thing is accomplished by
          writing Set_Color(Red). The Ada program may just as well
          write Set_Color(1) since the binding merely sets a constant
          Red to be equal to the integer 1. Many such numeric constants
          from the C API are given names in this thick binding. These
          renamed integers are discussed more fully in Section 7.2.
                The disadvantage of this renaming is that it makes
          referring to the PLplot documentation somewhat awkward. There
          might be, at some time, a utility for easing this problem by
          providing an HTML file with links so that a "normal" PLplot
          name can be linked to the "Ada" name along with the
          appropriate entry in the Ada specification, as well as
          another HTML file with links from the "Ada" name directly to
          the PLplot web page that documents that name. It might also
          be possible to provide an alternate version of the
          documentation with the enhanced names used. (The developer of
          the bindings has a sed file prepared  which makes most of the
          subroutine-name substitutions.) However, this thick binding
          retains the original C subprogram names as comments
          immediately above the function or procedure name in the code
          listing so it is relatively easy to locate the relevant item
          in the PLplot documentation.
                One simple rule applies in reading the PLplot API
          documentation: the argument names are in the same order in
          Ada as in the PLplot documentation (the names are different)
          except that all array lengths are eliminated. The PLplot
          documentation, for each subroutine, shows a "redacted"
          version which should be correct for Ada as well as other
          languages which have proper arrays.
                The standard bindings are in the Ada files plplot.ads
          and plplot.adb.
    4.4 Thick Binding Using Traditional Names
                This thick binding provides exactly the same
          functionality as the standard thick binding but retains the
          original names as used in the C code and the PLplot
          documentation.
                The traditional bindings are in the Ada files
          plplot_traditional.ads and plplot_traditional.adb.
    4.5 Examples
              An important part of the Ada bindings is the examples,
      some 30 of which demonstrate how to use many of the features of
      the PLplot package. These examples also serve as a testbed for
      the bindings in Ada and other languages by checking the
      Postscript files that are generated by each example against those
      generated by the C versions. These examples have been completely
      re-written in Ada (but retain a C flavor in the names that are
      given to objects). All of the Ada examples generate exactly the
      same Postscript as the C versions, Examples 14 and 17 excepted
      since those operate interactively and don't (normally) make
      Postscript. Two  versions of each example are available, one
      calling the standard binding and the other the traditional
      binding. (In development, a sed script does almost all of the
      conversion automatically.)
5 Obtaining the Software
          There are three software components that you will need: an
  Ada compiler, the PLplot library, and the Ada bindings.
    5.1 Obtaining an Ada compiler
                You will need an Ada compiler in order to use the Ada
          PLplot bindings. There are several compilers available. Here,
          we will focus on the free, open source compiler that is
          included with the GNU Compiler Collection, (gcc) which is at
          the center of much of the open source software movement. The
          gcc Ada compiler is known as GNAT, for GNU NYU Ada
          Translator, where NYU stands for New York University.
          (Although GNAT was originally developed at NYU, it has for
          many years been developed and supported commercially by
          AdaCore with academic and pro versions available.)
               Your computer may already have GNAT installed, or you
          can download it from gcc.gnu.org <http://gcc.gnu.org/>.
          Another route to obtaining GNAT is from the AdaCore page,
          libre2.adacore.com <https://libre2.adacore.com/>. There are
          versions for many operating systems and processors including
          Apple's OS X or its open source version Darwin, Linux, and
          Windows. The gcc and AdaCore versions differ in their
          licenses. Download the version that you need and follow the
          installation instructions. 
    5.2 Download and install PLplot
                PLplot can be downloaded from the PLplot home page at
          sourceforge.net—plplot
          <http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot>. Follow the
          installation instructions after downloading. The installation
          process is more involved than other open source software and
          requires that your computer has cmake installed. OS X users
          can try installing PLplot in its entirety from MacPorts but
          that activity is not officially supported by the PLplot
          developers. The advantage of using MacPorts is that all
          installation dependencies are automatically installed for you.
    5.3 Download the Ada bindings to PLplot
                The third major software component is the bindings
          themselves. Since they are currently included with the PLplot
          software itself, there is no need to download them from
          another place.
                The bindings themselves are six Ada source files
          named (using GNAT filename extensions) plplot.ads,
          plplot.adb, plplot_traditional.ads, plplot_traditional.adb,
          plplothin.ads, plplotthin.adb. There are two additional
          files, plplot_auxiliary.ads and plplot_auxililary.adb which
          will be discussed later, in Section 9. These can be stored
          somewhere on your system's search paths for easy access.
6 How to use the Ada bindings
    6.1 Ada 95 versus Ada 2005
                The bindings will work for either Ada 95 or Ada 2005.
          The only difference that concerns PLplot users is that Ada
          2005, in Annex G.3, provides declarations for real-valued
          vectors and matrices (along with some other functionality).
          These declarations make available type Real_Vector and type
          Real_Matrix.
                The installation process for PLplot requires you to
          select Ada 95 or Ada 2005. After that, the correct bindings
          are generated automatically depending on your choice. The
          differences are very minor: If Ada 2005, the type
          declarations provided according to Annex G.3 are used; if Ada
          95, similar type declarations are provided. For the most
          part, you don't need to think about this much. However, see
          Section 9, Compilation Notes, if you are using Ada 95 and
          need to declare vectors or matrices. The design goal in
          either case is to encourage users to use Real_Vector and
          Real_Matrix since these are the "official" versions of these
          entities as of Ada 2005. Someone using objects based on these
          type definitions in Ada 95 in their PLplot programs should
          expect their programs to work without modification if they
          should switch to Ada 2005.
    6.2 GNAT versus non-GNAT
                The bindings were made using the GNAT compiler and
          there is a slight dependence on that compiler. Specifically,
          the Unrestricted_Access attribute of GNAT was used in making
          the function Matrix_To_Pointers in plplotthin.adb and in a
          few callbacks. Matrix_To_Pointers is called whenever an Ada
          matrix (2D array) is passed to a PLplot subroutine. For more
          about Unrestricted_Access attribute, see Implementation
          Defined Attributes in the GNAT Reference Manual. This
          dependency shouldn't be difficult to remove by either
          incorporating the GNAT code which implements it, by following
          the TO-DO comment near the function definition in
          plplotthin.adb, or by providing the proper aliasing.
                Another GNAT dependency is used to parse command line
          arguments in a C-like way.
                Most of the GNAT dependencies can be found by
          searching the source code for "GNAT" and
          "Unrestricted_Access."
                The GNAT dependence, though slight, will no doubt
          frustrate users of other Ada compilers. We welcome comments
          from those users, especially comments with specific
          suggestions on how to remove any GNAT-specific usages.
    6.3 Sample command line project
                It is instructive to present a simple example that
          can be compiled and run from the command line. Although this
          example is specific to one installation, it should be fairly
          straightforward to adapt it to another installation. Toward
          that end, it is helpful to understand the PLplot lingo of
          "build directory" and "installation directory."
                Here is a simple program that will generate a plot of
          part of a parabola.
        with
              PLplot_Auxiliary,
              PLplot;
          use
              PLplot_Auxiliary,
              PLplot;

          procedure Simple_Example is
              x, y : Real_Vector(-10 .. 10);
          begin
              for i in x'range loop 
                  x(i) := Long_Float(i);
                  y(i) := x(i)**2;
              end loop;

              Initialize_PLplot; -- Call this only once.
              Simple_Plot(x, y); -- Make the plot.
              End_PLplot;        -- Call this only once.
          end Simple_Example;

                Next is a bash script that will compile, bind, and
          link it. It is installation-specific in that paths to the
          GNAT compiler, PLplot libraries, and BLAS (Basic Linear
          Algebra System) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) are
          hard-coded. You will have to adjust the paths to fit your
          installation. Some Linux installations which have GNAT 4.3 or
          later (Ada 2005) pre-installed might have already set the
          paths to the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
                (Note that the G.3 Annex of Ada 2005, in the GNAT
          version, depends heavily on BLAS and LAPACK. These packages
          are tried-and-true packages that are available from several
          places in either C or Fortran versions. The present example
          is specific to OS X which has them pre-installed.)

          #!/bin/bash
          /usr/local/ada-4.3/bin/gnatmake simple_example.adb \
          -aI/usr/local/plplot_build_dir/bindings/ada \
          -aL/usr/local/plplot_build_dir/bindings/ada/CMakeFiles/plplota
          dad.dir \
          -largs \
          /usr/local/plplot/lib/libplplotd.dylib \
          /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libblas.dylib \
          /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/liblapack.dylib

                Beware of inadvertent line wraps in the above code.
                The resulting binary program can be run by typing
        ./simple_example
7 Unique Features of the Ada bindings
          The Ada bindings have been augmented with a number of
  features that are not present in other languages which work with
  PLplot. These features are intended to greatly simplify the use of
  PLplot; many users will find that they can do most of their work
  using these "Simple" plotters. Also included are facilities for
  easily manipulating the PLplot color tables
    7.1 High-level features for simplified plotting
        Foreground-background control
            Draw_On_Black, Draw_On_White
                The default for PLplot is to draw its graphics on a
                  black background. A white background can be used
                  instead with Draw_On_White or reset to the original
                  mode with Draw_On_Black. Each of these manipulates
                  color map 0 by swapping black and white so that
                  e.g.with Draw_On_White, formerly white lines on a
                  black background autotmatically become black lines on
                  a white background.
        Simple Plotters
                  Several high-level but flexible plotters are
          available, and more might be added in the future. It is
          expected that many users will find that these high-level
          routines are adequate for most of their day-to-day plotting.
            Multiplot_Pairs
                Plot up to five x-y pairs with easy labeling,
                  coloring, line width and styles, justification, and
                  zooming.
            Simple_Plot
                Plot up to five y's against a single x with easy
                  labeling and automatic line colors and styles.
            Simple_Plot_Log_X
                Same as Simple_Plot but with logarithmic x-axis.
            Simple_Plot_Log_Y
                Same as Simple_Plot but with logarithmic y-axis.
            Simple_Plot_Log_XY
                Same as Simple_Plot but with logarithmic x- and
                  y-axes.
            Simple_Plot_Pairs
                Plot up to five x–y pairs with easy labeling and
                  automatic line colors and styles.
            Single_Plot
                Plot a single x–y pair with flexible labels, axis
                  styles, colors, line width and style, justification,
                  and zooming.
            Simple_Contour
                Make a contour plot with labels
            Simple_Mesh_3D
                Easy 3D mesh plot with labels, zooming, and
                  perspective controls
            Simple_Surface_3D
                Easy 3D surface plot with labels, zooming, and
                  perspective controls
        Simple color map manipulations
                  PLplot provides extensive manipulation and control of
          two separate color maps, color map 0 and color map 1. The Ada
          binding makes basic manipulations easier and also adds
          facilities for making snapshots of color map 0 so that any
          state of the map can easlily be restored later. An initial
          snapshot is taken when the package is initialized so that the
          default color settings can always be restored after having
          been changed.
                  Another set of features lets the user reset the 16
          individual colors in color map 0 after a color definition has
          been changed. It is important to note that while
          Set_Pen_Color(Red) (plcol0 in the traditional binding)
          normally does what it says, Red simply has the value 1. If
          the user changes the color map so that 1 corresponds to
          another color, then Set_Pen_Color(Red) will draw in that
          color instead of red. To always assure that red is drawn even
          if the color map has been changed for integer 1, use
          Set_Pen_Color(Reset_Red) instead. These 16 "reset" functions
          return the appropriate default integer for the specified
          color but also reset that slot in the color table so that a
          subsequent call such as Set_Pen_Color(Red) will also cause
          drawing in red.
                  Color map 1 also gets a easy-to-use makeover for Ada
          users. There are several pre-built color themes that are
          useful for quickly making surface and mesh plots,
          Color_Themes_For_Map_1_Type. These color themes can be
          quickly applied with Quick_Set_Color_Map_1.
                  Miscellaneous other Ada features include a pre-built
          mask function for Shade_Regions that does no masking; perhaps
          the most useful purpose is to provide a template for writing
          mask functions that do mask. And there is a handy function
          for calculating the contour levels for making contour plots.
            Color table snapshots
                Make_Snapshot_Of_Color_Map_0
                Restore_Snapshot_Of_Color_Map_0
                Restore_Default_Snapshot_Of_Color_Map_0
            Color resetting functions for the 16 colors of color map 0

            Other features

                  no masking: Mask_Function_No_Mask
                An easy way to calculate an array of contour levels
                  for contour plots: Calculate_Contour_Levels
    7.2 Integer-options Given Ada Names
              The C version of PLplot uses a number of integers to mean
      specific things. Unfortunately, the meaning is lost when it it
      consigned to being a mere integer with no name. The Ada binding
      partially rectifies this situation by giving names to these
      integer constants—the integer can still be used if desired. (A
      more complete and safer rectification would use enumerated types.)
              Below is a listing of at least the contexts in which
      these "re-namings" have been applied. In some cases the entire
      range of values is listed, but if there are more than about four
      such values for each context, only a sampling is given.
        Instances
            Colors: Plot_Color_Type
                0 is Black, 1 is Red, etc.
            Justification for plots: Justification_Type
                User_Justified
                Not_Justified
                Justified
                Justified_Square_Box
            Axis styles: Axis_Style_Type
                Linear_Major_Grid
                Linear_Minor_Grid
                etc.
            Font styles: Font_Style_Type
                Normal_Font
                Roman_Font
                Italic_Font
                Script_Font
            Character sets: Character_Set_Type
                Standard_Character_Set
                Extended_Character_Set
            Plot orientation: Orientation_Type
                Landscape
                Portrait
            Modes for parsing command line arguments: Parse_Mode_Type
                E.g. PL_PARSE_PARTIAL
            Descriptions of map outlines (continents, states, etc.):
              Map_Type
                Continents
                USA_and_States
                Continents_and_Countries
                USA_States_and_Continents
            Various style and view options for 3D and surface plots
                E.g. Lines_Parallel_To_X
            Kind of gridding algorithm for interpolating 2D data to a
              grid: Gridding_Algorithm_Type
                E.g. Grid_Bivariate_Cubic_Spline_Approximation
            Flags for histogram style
                E.g. Histogram_Default
            Flags for histogram binning
                E.g. Bin_Default
            Names for color space models
                Hue, Lightness, Saturation: HLS
                Red, Green, Blue: RGB
    7.3 One-offs
                Convenient string handling for Get_Device_Name
          (plgdev in the traditional binding); a function version is
          provided that simplifies the string handling associated with
          this feature.
                Overloaded Set_Line_Style (plstyl in the traditional
          binding) with a version that takes a single argument,
          Default_Continuous_Line. This replaces the awkward situation
          of calling the normal versions of these procedures with
          unused arguments simply to set the line style to the default,
          continuous, line.
                The contour plotter Contour_Plot_Irregular_Data
          (plfcont in the traditional binding) is provided for making
          contour plots from irregularly spaced data. This feature is
          not documented in the PLplot API documentation. 
8 Parts That Retain a C Flavor
          There remains at least one area in the Ada bindings which is
  still affected by the C underpinnings. This might be cleaned up in
  future versions. There might be other residual C influence as well.
    8.1 Map-drawing
                plmapform as called by Draw_Latitude_Longitude
          (plmap) and Draw_Latitude_Longitude (plmeridians)
                This is the only place in the PLplot bindings where a
          C subprogram calls an Ada subprogram while passing an array.
          If the array is unconstrained, there is no guarantee that it
          will work because C has no way of telling Ada what offset to
          use for the beginning of the array. But passing a constrained
          array is acceptable with the downside that the array size
          must be fixed within the bindings as being large enough to
          handle any situation; currently, it is sized as 0 .. 2000.
          See Example 19 for how this is handled in by the user
          program. The constrained array is called
          Map_Form_Constrained_Array.
9 Known Issues
    9.1 Stripchart labelling
                In Example 17, all of the stripchart labels are the
          same regardless of the fact that the calling program  sets
          them to be different. This is likely to affect user programs
          in the same manner.
    9.2 Documentation
                In numerous places in the documentation, a feature is
          listed or described as "C only." Many of these features are
          actually available in Ada. For example, in Contour_Plot
          (plcont in the traditional binding), the transformation from
          array indices to world coordinates is mentioned as "C only"
          but is actually available in Ada.
10 Compilation notes
    10.1 Ada 95 Versus Ada 2005
                As discussed in Section 6.1, the bindings are made to
          work with Ada 95 but to also take advantage of the Annex G.3
          (vector-matrix) features of Ada 2005. Actually, this
          adaptation takes place during the PLplot build process when
          DHAVE_ADA_2007=OFF or DHAVE_ADA_2007=ON is chosen; the
          appropriate binding source files are generated automatically.
          User programs will work with either compiler type without
          modification.
    10.2 GNAT Dependence
                There is a slight but significant dependence on the
          GNAT version of Ada. This is discussed more fully in Section
          6.2
    10.3 Compiler Warnings
                During normal compilation of the Ada bindings,
          approximately a dozen warnings are generated, in pairs, of
          the following form:
        bar.adb:46: warning: type of argument "foo" is unconstrained
          array
        bar.adb:46: warning: foreign caller must pass bounds
          explicitly
        These are normal and an unavoidable consequence of some of
          the callback routines interacting with the underlying C code.
    10.4 PLplot_Auxiliary
                The bindings include files PLplot_Auxiliary.ads and
          PLplot_Auxiliary.adb. These files are currently used to
          provide a few convenience subprograms that are used in the
          examples. However, they are also very tightly associated with
          the above-mentioned facility to accommodate either Ada 95 or
          Ada 2005 compilers. The current situation is such that if the
          user is using an Ada 95 compiler and requires the Real_Vector
          or Real_Matrix type definitions, then he/she should with
          PLplot_Auxiliary. If in doubt, PLplot_Auxiliary can always be
          with-ed without harm. In the future, this confusion might be
          removed and the need for PLplot_Auxiliary removed. (However,
          user programs that with it should still work without change.)
11 Notes for Apple Macintosh OS X users
          The following comments apply to users of Apple Macintosh
  computers which run OS X. OS X users may use Apple's free integrated
  development environment (IDE) or may prefer other methods such as
  using a favorite editor and building from the command line.
          OS X users should be aware that an excellent graphical
  terminal program is available and is highly recommended. It is called
  AquaTerm and is a full Cocoa program with window control. Performing
  a cut operation places a PDF of the front window on the clipboard, a
  convenience when working with other graphics or word processing
  programs.
    11.1 Using Apple's Xcode IDE
                The Macintosh Ada community has made a plug-in for
          Apple's free Xcode integrated development environment (IDE)
          that makes programming Ada in Xcode possible. The plug-in is
          included with the compiler that is available at
          www.macada.org <http://www.macada.org/>. Since Xcode is based
          on gcc, it is possible to work in the various gcc languages
          as well as to incorporate binaries such as the PLplot library.
                In order to make an Xcode project, drag-and-drop
          source files and the PLplot library file to the Groups &
          Files pane of an Ada project. There are a few idiosyncrasies
          that you may encounter so make sure to contact the very
          friendly Macintosh Ada mailing list at www.macada.org
          <http://www.macada.org/> or study the FAQ at that same site
          if you have any difficulties.
    11.2 A Note on AquaTerm
                AquaTerm is a display option available on Macintosh
          computers using OS X and is supported by PLplot. It is a
          native Cocoa graphics "terminal" that is highly recommended.
          All output is antialiased and is easily cut-and-pasted in OS
          X's native PDF format. Get it at
          sourceforge.net—showfiles.php
          <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=39915>.
           It can also be installed from either the Fink
          www.finkproject.org <http://www.finkproject.org/> or MacPorts
          www.macports.org—projects.
          <http://www.macports.org/projects.> projects.
    11.3 X11
                Apple supplies the X11 windowing system that is
          popular on some other Unix and Linux operations systems as
          part of the Developer Tools. All PLplot programs made with
          the Ada bindings will run on X11. In fact, some types of
          interactivity such as Examples 14 and 17 will not run on
          Apple's X11 (as of OS X 10.4 at least) and must be run on X11
          (or some other output device such as TCL/TK).
    11.4 GNAT for OS X
                Apple Macintosh users will benefit from a pre-built
          version of GNAT that comes packaged using the usual Apple
          software installer and is strongly recommended. This compiler
          is available for both PowerPC and Intel Macintoshes at
          www.macada.org—Welcome.html.
          <http://www.macada.org/macada/Welcome.html.>. This site is
          traditionally rather confusing but the mailing list is
          extremely helpful. The installer also includes an
          Ada-specific plug-in for Apple's Xcode IDE which is strongly
          recommended if you plan to work on this platform. Xcode is
          part of the Developer Tools and is available on the Apple
          system disks that also contain the operating system or it can
          be downloaded for free from developer.apple.com—xcode
          <http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/>.
