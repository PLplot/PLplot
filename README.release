PLplot Release 5.15.0

This is a release of the PLplot plotting package. It represents the
ongoing best efforts (roughly ??? commits since the last release) of
the PLplot development community to improve this package, and it is
the only version of PLplot that we attempt to support.  Releases in
the 5.x.y series should be available roughly two times per year.

Note that PLplot has been continuously developed since 1986 so it has
accumulated a lot of cruft since that time.  Therefore, we are now
slowing removing that cruft to improve the lot of both new users and
new members of the development team.  As a result virtually every
PLplot release has some backwards incompatibilities introduced to help
clean it up so please pay careful attention to the OFFICIAL NOTICES
FOR USERS below (and also in the various sections of
README.cumulated_release if you need backward incompatibility
information for several recent releases) where we document such
incompatibilities to make life easier for those who have prior
experience with older PLplot releases.

If you encounter a problem with this release that is not already
documented on our bug tracker, then please send bug reports to PLplot
developers via our mailing lists (preferred for initial discussion of
issues) at <http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/mailman/>. If it turns out
no quick resolution is possible via mailing-list discussion, then the
issue should be placed on our bug tracker at
<http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/>.

1. OFFICIAL NOTICES FOR USERS

1.1 CMake version compatibility

Our build system is implemented using CMake.  The minimum version of
CMake we allow is 3.7.2 on all platforms.

This particular PLplot release has been comprehensively tested for
CMake versions 3.7.2 through 3.13.1 on a variety of platforms (see
<http://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Testing_Reports> for details
of recent tests on all platforms).

Therefore, if your CMake version is <= 3.13.1 and satisfies the above minimum
CMake version requirement there is an excellent chance that our build
system will work well.  Furthermore, if you try later CMake versions
as they are released during the life of this PLplot release, our build
system will likely continue to work well because CMake has an excellent
reputation for preserving backwards compatibility.  But if you get
build-system trouble for versions of CMake greater than 3.13.1, the
first thing you should try is CMake-3.13.1 which has been well-tested
by us.

1.2 Remove typedefs for PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER and PL_GENERIC_POINTER

typedef PLPointer   PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER;
typedef PLPointer   PL_GENERIC_POINTER;

were introduced as of 5.12.0 as the start of a plan that was almost
immediately abandoned.  So these typedefs were officially deprecated
in 5.13.0, and they are now being dropped as of this release.

This cruft-removal causes a backwards-incompatible change to our C API
that is of no concern for users who do not use PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER
and PL_GENERIC_POINTER in their code.  However, for the remaining
users the solution must be to replace PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER and
PL_GENERIC_POINTER by PLPointer everywhere in their code.

1.3 Fix typedef for PLINT_NC_VECTOR

This typedef (first defined as of 5.12.0) has been changed from

-typedef int *                 PLINT_NC_VECTOR;
+typedef PLINT *               PLINT_NC_VECTOR;

to fix an inconsistency that was incorrectly and inadvertently created
for 5.12.0 between this typedef and all other PLINT* typedefs.

For systems that provide the stdint.h header the PLINT typedef is

typedef int32_t        PLINT;

but for those systems that do not provide that header, this typedef is

typedef int            PLINT;

Therefore the above change to the typedef for PLINT_NC_VECTOR is
backwards-incompatible (requiring recompilation of user code but no
changes to that code to fix the problem) for users with systems that
(a) provide the stdint.h header, and (b) define int differently than
int32_t for those systems.

2. Improvements relative to the previous release

2.1  Bug fixes

The bug fixes in this release are noted in the roughly 150 commit messages
collected in ChangeLog.release.

2.2  Update PLplot to be consistent with modern free software

This ongoing project is implemented by making sure PLplot passes all
[comprehensive
tests](<https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Testing_Reports) on the
Debian Testing platform which is a high-quality rolling release that
keeps up to date with modern free software development.  As a result
PLplot should be compatible with the following modern versions of free
software packages:

* CMake-3.13.1	      		 (core, bindings, and device drivers)
* gcc 8.2.0			 (core)
* qhull 2015.2			 (optional core interpolation functionality)
* shapelib 1.4.1		 (optional core map functionality)
* swig 3.0.12			 (java, lua, octave, and python bindings)
* gnatmake/gdc/gfortran 8.2.0	 (ada, d, and fortran bindings)
* g++ 8.2.0			 (c++ binding and psttf and wxwidgets device drivers)
* pango 1.42.3, cairo 1.16.0	 (cairo device driver)
* openjdk 11.0.1		 (java binding)
* lua 5.3.5			 (lua binding)
* camlidl 1.05, ocaml 4.05	 (ocaml binding)
* octave 4.4.1	      		 (octave binding)
* python 3.6.7			 (python binding)
* Qt 5.11.2			 (qt binding and qt device driver)
* Tcl/Tk 8.6.8			 (tcl/tk binding and tk device driver)
* libx11 2:1.6.7		 (tk and xwin device drivers)
* wxWidgets 3.0.4		 (wxwidgets binding and device driver)

Notes for this table:

* The Debian Testing package for swig 3.0.12 contains a swig fix that should be
  generally released for swig-4 that allows PLplot to build an Octave-4.4 binding.
  If your swig-3 version does not have this fix, you should use Octave-4.2
  until swig-4 is released.

* The Debian Testing package for lua 5.3.3 currently perpetuates
  [a serious bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=902238)
  for that particular upstream version.  The above good results for lua
  5.3.5 were generated with a locally built version of upstream 5.3.5.

3. PLplot testing

Comprehensive tests of this release are documented in
<https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Testing_Reports>.
In addition, developers and users who have used the git master tip
version for all their plotting needs during this release cycle have
provided additional important testing of this release of PLplot.
