Aside from the exceptions explicitly noted below in the "Other
Copyrights" sections, all files in the PLplot package may be
distributed under the following terms:

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

The text of this license is given in the file COPYING.LIB in the
distribution directory.

The intent behind distributing the vast majority of
PLplot files under the LGPL is to ensure that it
continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though there
are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and pltcl.
The ties between these programs and the library are so great that I
consider them as part of the library, so distribution under the terms of
the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed and encouraged to
use PLplot as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the PLplot source
code must remain freely available, including any modifications you make to
it (if you distribute a program based on the modified library).  Please
read the full license for more info.

cmake/test_ada/cmake/Modules/CMakeTestAdaCompiler.cmake

were originally distributed by Kitware Inc. and were downloaded at
various epochs by PLplot developers and then further modified by us.

The CMake-related D language support files
cmake/modules/language_support/cmake/CMakeD_Copyright.txt

were downloaded from Kitware Inc. by CMakeD developers Selman Ulug and
Tim Burrell <http://www.dsource.org/projects/cmaked>, substantially
modified by them, and then further downloaded from that site in 2009
by us and further modified by us.

This complete group of CMake-related files sometimes has slightly
different licensing language depending on download epoch so look at
each of the above files for the definitive source of licensing
language.  However, in all cases that language is very similar to the
modern version of the license for CMake itself which is the
OSI-approved BSD 3-clause License (see <https://cmake.org/licensing>
for further details).
