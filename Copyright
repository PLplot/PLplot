Aside from the exceptions explicitly noted below in the "Other
Copyrights" sections, all files in the PLplot package may be
distributed under the following terms:

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

The text of this license is given in the file COPYING.LIB in the
distribution directory.

The intent behind distributing the vast majority of
PLplot files under the LGPL is to ensure that it
continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though there
are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and pltcl.
The ties between these programs and the library are so great that I
consider them as part of the library, so distribution under the terms of
the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed and encouraged to
use PLplot as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the PLplot source
code must remain freely available, including any modifications you make to
it (if you distribute a program based on the modified library).  Please
read the full license for more info.

were originally distributed by Kitware Inc. and were downloaded at
various epochs by PLplot developers and then further modified by us.

The D language support files in the subdirectories

cmake/modules/language_support/cmake-d_fork and
cmake/modules/language_support/cmake-d_fork/Platform

were downloaded from the [cmake-d project](https://github.com/dcarp/cmake-d)
as of 2019-08-14 and subsequently modified by one of our developers
(Alan W. Irwin) to satisfy PLplot's build-system needs for the D
compilers, gdc, ldc, and dmd.  These files are all licensed under the
MIT license (see cmake/modules/language_support/cmake-d_fork/LICENSE
for the terms of that license).

The ndiff-2.00 software package in utils/ndiff was downloaded from
ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/ndiff-2.00.tar.gz and gpg verified
with ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/ndiff-2.00.tar.gz.sig with the
directory name changed from utils/ndiff-2.0.0 to utils/ndiff.  The
license of this utility software is GPL version 2 or above.  See
utils/ndiff/COPYING for the exact details of that license.
