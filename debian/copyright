Below is the copyright notice that comes with the source distribution
(reference to the location of LGPL text in the Debian system was
added):


Copyright (from file "Copyright" in the pristine source distributions;
added text for the Debian package are between brackets):

The PLplot package may be distributed under the following terms:

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Library General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
    Software Foundation, Inc. [59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA
    02111-1307, USA.]

The text of this license is given in the file COPYING.LIB in the
distribution directory.  [In Debian systems, see the file
/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL.]  Exceptions are noted below.

The intent behind distributing PLplot under the LGPL is to ensure that it
continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though there
are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and pltcl.
The ties between these programs and the library are so great that I
consider them as part of the library, so distribution under the terms of
the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed and encouraged to
use PLplot as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the PLplot source
code must remain freely available, including any modifications you make to
it (if you distribute a program based on the modified library).  Please
read the full license for more info.
