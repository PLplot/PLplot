plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030401-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.
  * debian/control: Added build-dependency on matwrap.  Changed sections of
    libplplot-dev and python-plplot to libdevel and python.

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030325-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: The problem with the non-numerical version
    number in pkgIndex.tcl has been fixed (closes: #185677).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Mar 2003 15:34:25 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030320-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: configure has now new options for
    controlling configuration and building of the Docbook documentation.
    This should generated less warning messages in the autobuilders.
  * debian/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.9.  Added
    libxml-parser-perl and libxml-dom-perl to Build-Depends, since these
    Perl modules are needed for the Octave bindings.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Mar 2003 09:27:35 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030319-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: Since my last upload, there has been only
    improvements in the Octave bindings.
  * debian/control: Set Priority: extra for plplot-tcl-dev, such that
    debcheck will not complain.  Also, changed the order of
    octave2.1-headers and octave2.0-headers in Build-Depends.  This will
    probably make the autobuilders to install the more recent version of
    Octave and fix the build problems.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2003 08:31:30 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030317-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: fixes in the Octave bindings and in the
    Docbook documentation.  The configure script does not choke anymore if
    the swig program is not available (closes: #184694, closes: #183947).
  * Fixed the mess with the Python version.  Now, both Python 2.1 and 2.2
    are accepted and the dependency field of package python-plplot is
    obtained through the substvar ${python:Depends}, which is set in the
    rule config of debian/rules.
  * PLplot installs now the .oct file in a versioned directory.  The
    correct dependency of octave-plplot is now obtained through the
    substvar ${octave:Depends (closes: #183913).
  * debian/control:
      - Added dependencies on libqhull-dev and libfreetype6-dev to
        libplplot-dev, such that the examples will compile.
      - Removed build-dependency to xlib6g-dev.
  * debian/rules added --enable-smart-ac-output option to configure, to
    avoid needless recompilation of the documentation.
  * Moved the plplot_libtool script from libplplot5 into libplplot-dev.
  * The ntk driver is now correctly put in the plplot-tcl package, instead
    of libplplot5.  This was forcing the erroneous dependency of
    libplplot5 on Tcl/Tk 8.3.  Shame on me!
  * debian/control: Added build-dependencies to libpng3-dev and
    libjpeg62-dev, such that plplot-gd is built correctly.

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030307-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources: that are slight improvements in the Octave
    bindings, regarding the user function toggle_plplot_use.
  * debian/control:
      - Changed some Priority and Section headers to match the override
        file in the Debian repository, such that the package upload will
        be accepted (hopefully).
      - Added m4 to Build-Depends.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Mar 2003 09:47:22 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030306-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources:
      - The new API plgriddata has been added, as well as the nn and csa
        libraries.
      - The pkg-config files changed place.
      - Xwin driver is now Pthreaded.
      - Patch to plsym.c allowing vertical text in the bottom and top axes.
  * debian/rules: Removing debian/files for lintian cleanness.  After
    installation, the dvi form of the documentation is deleted.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Added the .ps.gz documentation file.
  * debian/control: For plplot-doc, added Conlicts: relationship to
    libplplot5, since the .ps.gz have been moved.  Improved description
    for the plplot-doc package.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Mar 2003 14:47:07 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030301-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Fixed gnome driver, which was plotting
    extraneous text on the canvas.  Also, the Octave initalization file is
    fixed now, and use_plplot really works.
  * debian/libplplot-dev.files: Added /usr/lib/pkgconfig dir.
  * debian/control: Removed optional dependencies on octave2.0, since the
    octave-plplot package is built for Octave 2.1 and the .oct file will not
    work with 2.0.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Feb 2003 19:40:23 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030227-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the first release of this cvs snapshot series to the Debian
    repository (closes: #101264).
  * A big thanks to David Schleef, who has acted as interim maintainer
    (and made a great job) while I have been unavailable.
  * Many bugs that have been around for ages are fixed in this
    release:
    - The plplot-tcl package depends on tcl8.3 and tk8.3 (closes: #117186).
    - The octave-plplot package is totally new and has been integrated
      into the upstream sources of PLplot (closes: #91308).  Octave
      bindings are working correctly now (closes: #158446).  In
      particular, the plplot_octave-demo.m script works fine (closes: #69710).
    - use_plplot.m works correctly now (closes: #181875, closes: #74908),
      and all the files are found in the LOADPATH of Octave (closes: #179224).
    - Python examples should run now, thanks to the new dynamic drivers
      scheme (closes: #92150).
    - All PLplot manpages have proper whatis entries nows (closes: #100867).
    - Dependences on tk8.3-dev have been dropped (closes: #167412).
    - Build failure on sparc, due to bad c++ command line options should
      be fixed now (it was already in David's NMU, closes: #86880).
    - Packages should be fully installable in unstable (closes: #161569).
    - "octave2.1-headers | octave2.0-headers" have been added to
      Build-Depends, so that octave-plplot can be built from source
      (closes: 117708).
    - Packages build correctly on m68k (fixed in David's NMU,
      closes: #159807).
    - A problem in setting up octave2.1 has been fixed in Dirk
      Eddelbuettel's NMU (closes: #123700).
    - There is no plplot-bin package anymore.  Also, there is no
      dependency on nonexistent ghostscript package (closes: #136358).
    - The build failure due to a wrong Python directory has been fixed
      (closes:  #159811).
  * debian/control: Added warning message telling that the packages are
    experimental.
  * plplot-doc.prerm: Calling install-info with the correct number of
    arguments (closes: #182509).

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Many DocBook related configuration
    problems have been fixed.
  * debian/rules: Added config-stamp creation to avoid double run of
    configure.  Run configure with --enable-docbook now.
  * debian/plplot-doc.prerm: Added file.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Feb 2003 23:19:45 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030225-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  Some rpath problems have been fixed, so
    that the package is Lintian clean as regard the rpath.
  * Created new package plplot-tcl-dev.
  * debian/rules: Give option --without-rpath to configure.
  * debian/control: Removed dependencies on packages necessary for
    compiling the DocBook documentation, since they will be available in
    the upstream distribution tarball.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Feb 2003 14:05:53 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030224-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  The info files and man pages are now
    included in the plplot-doc package.  There is also a new PLplot driver
    (mem).
  * debian/control: Added Build-Dependencies to Perl modules needed to
    generate the info form of documentation from the Docbook sources.
    Added build-dependency to libfreetype6-dev.  Added plplot-xwin
    dependency to plplot-tcl.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Added paths for info and man.
  * debian/rules: Give options --infodir and --with-freetype to
    configure.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Feb 2003 16:36:52 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030219-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.  The plplot_octave.oct file is installed
    in localoctfiledir, instead of octfiledir.  This avoids the versioned
    installation directory.
  * debian/control: octave-plplot does not depend anymore on a specific
    version of Octave.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Feb 2003 12:06:33 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030218-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Something was strangely broken with the inclusion of files in the
    plplot-doc pacakge, probably related to an extraneous config.cache
    file.  Fixed now.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Feb 2003 21:37:44 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030218-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources, with improved installation of Octave files.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Feb 2003 18:08:44 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030217-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Built with new CVS sources.
  * debian/rules:
    - Removed hacks for getting the Octave files correctly installed,
      since this is fixed in CVS now.
    - Added command to remove config.log and config.status files.  This
      makes lintian happy.
  * debian/octave-plplot.files: Included usr/share/doc/libplplot5/*.octave

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Feb 2003 18:34:29 +0100

plplot (5.2.0.cvs.20030214-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, built directly from the CVS sources.
  * These packages are still experimental and are provided to help the
    preparation to the next upstream release (probably 5.2.1).
  * There has been a huge reorganization of the packages, thanks to the new
    dynamical loading of driver modules.  There has been too many changes to
    report here.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Feb 2003 21:16:34 +0100

plplot (5.1.0-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Update for python-2.2 (Closes: #159807, #159811, #161569)
  # reenable plplot-python on all architectures
  * change Recommends: ghostscript (Closes: #136358)
  * Depend on autoconf-2.13, since scripts are broken for 2.50

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Fri, 11 Oct 2002 13:25:28 -0700

plplot (5.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * New upstream version (Closes: #101264)
  * handle changing of name of libplmatrixd to libtclmatrixd.  Since
    this library is only used by libplplotd, it is not a ABI change.
    libtclmatrixd should probably be in a separate directory or linked
    directly with libplplotd -- this needs to be coordinated with
    upstream, and may also be moot once this packaged is changed to
    use loadable modules for the drivers.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Thu, 15 Aug 2002 18:31:37 -0700

plplot (5.0.2-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Fix hppa build problems. Closes: #141723
  * Remove 'potato' from version number.

 -- LaMont Jones <lamont@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 21:22:06 -0600

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * debian/control, debian/rules: plplot indirectly Build-Depends
    on lapack to build python-plplot.  Since lapack is only available
    on a few architectures, this causes problems building the other
    packages on all architectures.  Fixed to Build-Depend and build
    python-plplot only on working architectures.

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Fri, 15 Mar 2002 20:49:18 -0500

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Fix build dependencies (Closes: #92344, #98119, #102014)
  * cf/syslog.in: backport configure rules for tcl/itcl and python2.1
    (fixes new build problems)
  * debian/control: add dependencies to plplot-dev (Closes: #101392)
  * remove use of {} globbing in debian/rules (Closes: #101259)
  * debian/changelog: removed emacs settings
  * debian/control: change the tk/tcl build dependencies to 8.3
  * debian/*: update for python2.1
  * debian/control: fix python dependencies to coorespond to policy
  * debian/control: remove dependency on itk3.1, since it's added by
    ${shlibs:Depends}
  * debian/*.shlibs: Added shlibs files
    Note: the libplmatrix entry in plplot-tcl.shlibs specifies
    plplot-xwin, but plplot-xwin doesn't actually have the
    library.  This is ok, since it should only be used by
    libplplotd.so.
  * Fixed packages interdependencies and added ${shlibs:Depends}
    where appropriate
  * Fixed postinst, prerm scripts to use debhelper

 -- David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 18:51:57 -0800

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Made plplot-common conflict and replace plplot <<
    5.0.2, because plplot-common took over plplot's FAQ file.  Thanks to
    Jim LewisMoss <dres@mindspring.com> (closes: #90846).
  * Removed some useless debian/*.dirs files, particularly
    plplot-tcl.dirs, which was creating a wrong directory
    /usr/lib/plplot5.0.1 (!).
  * Added more build dependencies, based on the buildd report on Sparc.
    Also, patched cf/sysloc.in to have configure finding the file tcl.h.
    Thanks to Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org> (closes: #91228).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 26 Mar 2001 17:34:01 +0200

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed a extraneous file in the upstream directory.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 22 Mar 2001 16:47:49 +0100

plplot (5.0.2-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Backported patch from CVS for using fseek/ftell everywhere to
    eliminate non-portable behavior (closes: #86512).
  * Changes in the upstream configuration file for making the installation
    relocatable.  This will be hopefully integrated upstream in the next
    release of PLplot, and the Debian diff file will be reduced to files
    in the debian/ directory.
  * debian/plplot-doc.doc-base, debian/plplot-doc.files: Added files.
  * debian/plplot-doc.postinst: Added file for installing info files.
  * Added html, pdf, ps, and info forms of the PLplot manual to the
    plplot-doc package.
  * debian/plplot-dev.files: Added man pages generated from the DocBook
    API documentation.
  * debian/rules: Added commands for installing files into the plplot-doc
    and plplot-dev packages.
  * debian/control: Make plplot-doc conflict with plplot << 5.  This is
    because of the info files.
  * debian/plplot-*.README.Debian: Updated.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 22 Mar 2001 14:14:35 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Changed section of plplot-dev to devel (to avoid mail
    notification sent by dinstall, that overrides my choice).  Made
    plplot-tcl depend on iwidgets3.1 (which is needed to run example
    tk02).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon, 19 Feb 2001 12:29:25 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Excluding examples/ dir from list of compressible files
    by dh_compress.
    Make x16.py non-executable, since it is lacking the initial #! line.
    Give explicit -l options for dh_shlibdeps for packages plplot-tcl and
    plplot-xwin.  This will avoid the wrong dependencies that were being
    generated.
  * debian/control: Build-depends on iTcl.  This will make the plplot-tcl
    package [incr Tcl]-able.  This is needed to run the tk/tk01 and
    tk/tk04 examples (thanks to Alan Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca> for
    pointing this out).  Also, made plplot-tcl depend on itk3.1.
  * examples/c/plcdemos.h: Removed #definition of PL_DOUBLE, as it is
    already done by plConfig.h.
  * cf/sysloc.in: Added /usr/include/itcl3.1/generic to incdirs_default.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 13:47:16 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make plplot-common conflict with older version of
    plplot.  This makes a smooth upgrade.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Feb 2001 12:53:09 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Better descriptions for plplot-c++ and plplot-common
    (thanks to Alan Irwin <irwin@beluga.phys.uvic.ca>).  Added "Replaces:"
    fields to plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl.  The dependencies now are
    simplified thanks to the use of a virtual package plplot-lib.
  * debian/plplot-doc.files: Removed file.
  * debian/plplot-dev.files: Addded usr/include.  This will put the header
    files into plplot-dev (thanks again to Alan).
  * Created new package plplot-bin with pltek, plpr and plm2gif, which
    were before in plplot-common.  This was causing circular dependency
    problems.
  * debian/plplot-common.files: Get some files that were wrongly going
    into the "empty" package plplot.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Tue, 13 Feb 2001 12:21:20 +0100

plplot (5.0.1-0.potato.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Starting with version 5.0.0, PLplot entered a
    new development phase.  The project is now hosted at SourceForge
    (http://plplot.sourceforge.net) and the current Debian maintainer is
    also involved with upstream development.
  * This release works with potato (hence the release number).
  * There has been an overall reorganisation of the packages.  There is
    now a package called plplot-common, containing the data files.
    plplot-xwin and plplot-tcl are both exclusive and contain the shared
    libs.  plplot-c++ has the C++ bindings shared lib.  python-plplot is
    working with Python 1.5 and has been reintroduced.  plplot-doc is for
    now just a boilerplate package, waiting for the DocBook docs to be
    introduced in PLplot 5.0.2.
  * Prompt flush for pltcl is working now (closes: #58273).
  * debian/control:
    - Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.1.0.
    - Added Build-Depends.
    - Forced conflict between plplot and plplot-tcl packages.
    - New descriptions for packages plplot-dev and plplot-doc to reflect
      the fact that examples go into plplot-dev and plplot-doc is just a
      placeholder for future inclusion of the documentation in DocBook
      format.
    - Updated URL location of the PLplpot website.
    - Reintroduced entry for python-plplot.  Updated its dependency on
      plplot-tcl.
  * debian/postinst: Place "exit 0" at the right place, allowing debhelper
    added code to be executed (closes: #77997).  Also, removed code for
    installing info manual.  In the future, this will go in pakcage
    plplot-doc.
  * debian/rules: Major rewrite to reflect the new features of upstream
    build and install.  The main novelty here is the capability of
    doing make install with another $prefix than that used for building.
  * debian/*.{docs,files}: Heavily modified to reflect the new upstream
    version.
  * debian/control-python, debian/fix-tk-path.pl, debian/postrm,
    debian/python-exec-header, debian/python-plplot.postinst.debhelper,
    debian/python-plplot.prerm.debhelper: Removed files.
  * debian/plplot-980407-plplot-980407-new.patch: Removed this obsolete
    file.

plplot (4.99j-11) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added --disable-linuxvga to configure options fixing an important bug
    report (closes: #65216).
  * The lib*tk files are moved to the right package now (plplot-tcl).
    This fixes the unnecessary dependency of the bare library package
    (plplot) on the TCl/Tk libraries.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Wed,  7 Jun 2000 18:00:18 +0200

plplot (4.99j-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Using option --without-f2c with ./configure.  This should avoid the
      build problems when the package f2c (which provides /usr/bin/fc) is
      installed (closes: #30944).
    - Erase empty dir usr/share/doc/examples after dh_movefiles.  This
      prevents the plplot from having junk in it.
  * debian/control: Excluded problematic package python-plplot.  Created
    file debian/control-pyhton for easy reversal in the future (closes:
    #33150).

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Mon,  8 Nov 1999 12:17:27 +0100

plplot (4.99j-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "#define PLPLOT_DOUBLE" to plcdemos.h.  This will allow
    compilation of the examples, due to the lacking of `PLPLOT_DOUBLE'
    definition (Closes: #49120, #36993).  Also added a note in
    plplot-dev.README.Debian indicating how to compile correctly.
  * FHS compliant.
  * Upgraded to Standards-Version 3.0.1 (requires debhelper >= 2.0.68).
  * debian/copyright: Right location for the LGPL.
  * cf/sysconf.in: Added `SHLIB_F77FLAGS="-fpic -fPIC"'.

 -- Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr>  Sat,  6 Nov 1999 21:01:13 +0100

plplot (4.99j-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled with new release of libc6 (cf discussion in debian-devel
    starting at
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9812/msg00998.html).
  * Changed LDC in cf/sysconf.in to F77 (link with gcc complains because

plplot (4.99j-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low, closes=29694 29704

  * Set Conflicts relationship because files were moved around in the
    latest release (Fixes Bug#29694, reported by  Francesco Potorti`
    <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>).
  * Rebuilt to fix bogus dependency on tkstep8.0 (closes Bug#29704
    reported by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>)

plplot (4.99j-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low, closes=28534

  * Uploading to frozen and unstable.  (The previous release, 4.99j-5, was
    rejected and I never reuploaded it.)
  * Revamped debian/rules with use of variables for the debian dirs.
  * Corrected typo in plplot-dev.README (closes Bug#28534).
  * No compression of executable exemples in package plplot-doc.
  * Fixed paths only for tk* scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples/tk.
  * Fixed permission for plcolor.tcl and tkdemos.tcl.
  * Fixed path for script x16.py (in plplot-doc).
  * Moved library files libMatrix and libplplotdtk from plplot-tcl to
    plplot.
  * Moved info file from the plplot-doc package to the base package
    plplot: this is the only documentation availalbe for the PLplot API.
  * Fixed typo ("\*") in debhelper compress files.
  * Fixed the problem related to the naming of shared libraries.
  * Improved "Description:" fields in debian/control:
    - Added "a scientific library" to first line (as suggested by
      Christopher J. Fearnley <cjf@I21.com>).
    - Included URL of PLplot homepage for each package.
  * dh_shlibdeps does not act on package python-plplot.
  * postinst and postrm test now for its argument.
  * Rewrote README.Debian files.

plplot (4.99j-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with patch from Joao Cardoso <jcardoso@inescn.pt> for Octave
    interface.  The patch file is included in the debian/ directory.
  * The orig.tar.gz and the diff.gz files were absent from 4.99j-4
    upload.  This is corrected now (bug reported by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).
  * Corrected sed expression for fixing the #! path in Python scripts
  * Corrected bug in debian/compress file which was causing compression of
    executable scripts under usr/doc/plplot/examples.
  * Created plplot-tcl.postinst with a call to ldconfig, as plplot-tcl
    includes shared libraries.
  * Links to the shared library are now Policy compliant, i.e. their names
    have only one number after .so.
  * debain/shlibs.local is renamed to debian/shlibs, and
    debian/plplot-tcl.shlibs is created.
  * The scripts installed under usr/lib/tcl8.0/plplot/ should not be
    executable.

plplot (4.99j-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/fix-tk-path.pl script is chmod'd in debian/rules files: now
    fixes really first part of Bug#26935.  Fix suggested by Paul Slootman
    <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>.
  * debian/control: plplot-doc architecture is now "all" and is compiled
    in the binary-indep section of debian/rules (suggested by
    Paul Slootman <paul@wau.mis.ah.nl>).  In order to do that, big changes
    in debian/rules were done.  Hope I did not screw things up.
  * debian/rules: Corrected hideous bug in chmod mode switches: "chmod -x"
    should be "chmod +x".
  * Corrected some typos in debian/control, debian/copyright.
  * cf/pkg_tcl.in: put number version in libMatrix.so (changed
    README.Debian to document the fix).
  * Moved libMatrix.so and libMatrix.a to plplot-dev package.
  * Moved libMatrix.so.* and libplplotdtk.so.* to plplot-tcl package, and
    made plplot-dev depend on plplot-tcl (changed debian/control file to
    reflect the changes).
  * I just realized that the upstream Python support works only with
    python-1.4.  I will fix this in the next release.

plplot (4.99j-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: fixing Python path for python scripts is done now with a
    sed command (get rid of debian/fix-python-path.pl).  Suggested by
    Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
  * Change in upstream file utils/pltek.c: gcc 2.7.2.3 deprecates the use
    of gets
  * Corrected file debian/plplot-dev.files, in order to have the files
    libMatrix.* included in the right package (plplot).
  * Make plplot conflict with plplot-dev for versions previous to this
    one, because of the move of libMatrix.*.
  * Changed mode of debian/fix-tk-path.pl script to executable (fixes
    first part of Bug#26935).
  * Building is now done entirely under debian/tmp (fixes second part of
    Bug#26935).
  * Buildning now `with double' instead of `with float', as required for
    the PLplot Octave interface.  Also, all instances of `libplotf*' were
    changed to `libplotd*' (in debian/rules and in debian/*.files).
  * /usr/lib/libplplotdtk.so.* files moved to the plplot package (they were
    in plplot-tcl): this fixes the problem of installing the plplot-dev
    package with a dangling symlink.
  * Removed file debian/dirs, which had no function at all.
  * Tcl/Tk and Python scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are now
    executable.
  * fix-tk-path.pl: corrected "/example/" -> "/examples/"

plplot (4.99j-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using debhelper 0.93 : README.Debian files are installed automatically
    by dh_installdocs
  * Fixed some problems found by Matthias Klose <doko@cs.tu-berlin.de>.
    Danke Matthias!
  * Corrected typo in fix-pytho-path.pl, that made all python examples
    have size equal to zero.
  * examples/Makefile has now correct references to /usr directories
  * Scripts under /usr/doc/plplot/examples are no more compressed
  * Tk scripts under /usr/doc/examples/tk have now the right path after
    `#!'
  * Added dependency python-tk to python-plplot
