    Build of doxygen-generated documentation: drop call/caller graphs

    It turned out these graphs increased the release tarball size from
    16MB to 567MB!  Which is completely unacceptable.  Also, it is far
    from clear how useful these graphs are to developers because of their
    huge complexity.  So drop those graphs completely at least for now
    (with the additional benefit that the doxygen documentation build time
    is greatly reduced by this change).

    Build system: implement and use PREBUILT_DOX_DOC option

    This option plays the same role for doxygen documentation as the
    PREBUILT_DOC option plays for the DocBook documentation.

    Those using a tarball with prebuilt doxygen documentation should use
    this option to allow use of that documentation (e.g., installation of
    it) just as if it was built as part of the build process.  So, for
    example, we use this option when testing installation of a release tarball
    in the make_tarball.sh script.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/make_tarball.sh -c -i /tmp/plplot_install

    and checking the doxygen build when creating the tarball
    and checking the doxygen install from the prebuilt
    doxygen documentation in that tarball.

    As far as I can tell, this cookbook is completely up to date now
    for this forthcoming plplot-5.12.0 release including how to make a signed tagged release,

    need to update this file again for the release.

    Fix website generation script

    The issue was no bindings or devices were allowed for the
    documentation build, and this interfered with the bindings
    dependencies for the doxygen build.  When this issue was
    addressed a warning about the Tcl bindings missing some generated files
    for doxygen analysis was removed.

    Make api2man.pl.in template for perl utility script produce results without trailing blanks

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by using the cmake -DBUILD_DOC=ON option,
    building the man target, and checking all results for trailing
    blanks using

    grep -l ' $' doc/docbook/src/*.3plplot

    I also spot checked some of those generated man results using

    nroff -man doc/docbook/src/<PLplot command name>.3plplot |less

    All was well except for a long-standing problem with the pages
    (plsurf3dl.3plplot, plot3dcl.3plplot) with UTF-8 characters where
    nroff on Debian Jessie still has troubles rendering those UTF-8
    glyphs.  However, if you set up the appropriate symlinks, the
    equivalent man command works fine for those pages, i.e., the bad
    rendering of UTF-8 glyphs appears to be an nroff bug.

    swig-generated octave and python bindings: update documentation strings to be consistent with api.xml

    I generated this change as follows: I built the
    check_swig_documentation target which uses the recently updated
    api2swigdoc.pl perl script to generate from api.xml a check file
    bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i_compare (without trailing
    blanks) in the build tree and then compares that result with
    bindings/swig-support/swig_documentation.i in the source tree.  That
    comparison initially failed (i.e., swig_documentation.i was not
    consistent with api.xml).  I addressed that issue (after spot-checking
    swig_documentation.i_compare) by copying swig_documentation.i_compare
    in the build tree on top of swig_documentation.i in the source tree.
    This change effectively updates the python and octave documentation
    strings to be consistent with api.xml.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target and also
    by following the test procedures for both python
    and octave help strings given in doc/docbook/README.developers.

    Build system: temporarily remove the check_all target dependency on check_api_xml_consistency

    The issue is the check_api_xml_consistency target has run-time issues
    when attempting to generate its check file (using the golang check
    routine).  I attribute this issue to the massive api.xml and plplot.h
    changes that have occurred since plplot-5.11.1 (where the
    check_api_xml_consistency worked), and some significant go language
    changes to the externally developed golang check executable will have
    to be made to get this to work again or else this whole consistency
    checking between api.xml and plplot.h needs reimplementation using a
    perl script.  Until one of these possible fixes are made, remove the
    check_all target dependency on check_api_xml_consistency so that
    the check_all target will continue to work.

    Build system: temporarily remove the check_all target dependency on check_plplot_h.inc

    The issue is that check_plplot_h.inc now encounters run-time issues when attempting
    to generate its check file using ocaml.  This is likely due to a namespace
    or installation issue with ocaml.  Until this issue is fixed, remove the
    check_all dependency on check_plplot_h.inc so that check_all will continue to work.

    api2swigdoc.pl utility: update entity processing

    I followed here the recently updated entity processing
    in api2man.pl.in.

    This change allowed the script to work again for
    the modern form (with much more entity use) of api.xml.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by using the cmake option DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON
    and building (without run-time errors when generating the check file) the check_swig_documentation
    target.  The comparison check file was different from the original and
    diff showed at least some of those differences were trailing blank issues
    introduced by the script which will have to be taken care of in a subsequent commit.

    Doxygen-generated documentation: Tweak configuration to avoid doxygen error and reduce doxygen warnings

    Excluded more files, i.e. the configured fortran included file that was causing an
    error, all java files (which were generating lots of warnings), bindings/python/Plframe.py
    that was causing a warning, and a deprecated
    wxwidgets file that we wanted to exclude for consistency with the
    exclusion of the other deprecated wxwidgets files although it didn't appear
    to cause any trouble.)  I also raised DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES from the default 50
    to 1000 which removed a lot of warnings.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by using the cmake parameter -DBUILD_DOX_DOC=ON and
    building the build_doxygen target.  As a result of the above changes there
    were no errors, and the warnings were reduced to

    Warning: doxygen no longer ships with the FreeSans font.
    /home/software/plplot/HEAD/plplot.git/bindings/d/plplot.d:18: warning: no matching class member found for
    /home/software/plplot/HEAD/plplot.git/bindings/d/plplot.d:19: warning: no matching class member found for

    AFAICT, that FreeSans warning is a false alarm from doxgyen since
    presumably doxygen can use system fonts, and the Debian package
    "fonts-freefont-ttf" has been installed which contains
    /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSans.ttf.

    Furthermore, the last two D warnings are also apparently false alarms
    caused by bad doxygen parsing of D aliases that makes the incorrect
    assumption that two different D aliases cannot refer to the same
    thing.

    DocBook documentation: substantial update to advanced usage chapter

    The summary of changes is as follows:

    * All references to examples are now linkable and point to our
      website examples (which give source code in all our supported
      languages as well as results).

    * Update the list of command-line options

    * To make this chapter much less specific to C, replace all C code
      fragments by references to the appropriate (linkable) examples.

    * Explain why the (pl)freetype approach is deprecated and because of
      that deprecation drop all the details concerning how that approach
      is implemented.

    * Rewrite/simplify the viewport, window, viewport annotation, and standard viewport sections

    * Rewrite/simplify the color section

    * Rewrite/simplify the 3D plotting section.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    DocBook documentation: Remove detailed API discussions from the "Simple Use of PLplot" chapter

    Detailed discussion of the API is the job of the "The Common API for
    PLplot" chapter.  So repeating this information in other chapters is
    unnecessary and leads to maintenance issues.  Instead, a simple
    cross-reference to the appropriate API is the correct thing to do in
    other chapters, and this commit implements that idea for the
    "Simple Use of PLplot" chapter.

    A substantial update to the DocBook documentation

    * The list of C typedefs used by PLplot has been updated in the C chapter.
      Also this chapter and the entities described in plplotdoc.xml have
      been updated so that all PLplot C types are linkable now (see the
      api*.xml changes below to take advantage of that capability).

    * The Fortran chapter has had a small update.

    * An important short paragraph of text was inserted in the simple,
      advanced, and api chapters to clarify how all our supported
      languages correspond with the C API, and corresponding C types that
      are often used in those chapters.

    * The "Drawing points" section of the simple chapter has been
      rewritten to emphasize plstring and to drop discussion of the
      detailed syntax (which is the job of the api chapter).

    * The advanced chapter has been substantially updated.

      + Tables of the file and interactive devices have been completely updated.

      + Dropped emphasis on plmeta and plrender since those are deprecated until
        Jim fixes them.

      + Substantial update of 3D plot descriptions.

    * The file devices chapter has been substantially updated.

    * The interactive devices chapter has been substantially updated.

    * The PLplot Tcl Matrix Extension section of the Tcl chapter has been
      rewritten to describe the new matrix slice, initialization, and
      assignment capabilities.

    * The "Common API for PLplot" chapter (api.xml) and "The Specialized
      C/C++ API for PLplot" (api-c.xml) chapters have been substantially improved. In
      particular, the new typedef'd arguments for our API (including C
      callback function types) are now used to document all arguments.
      This makes it much simpler to document those arguments in a way that
      is much less C specific which in turn makes it easier for users to
      infer the argument types to be used for the other languages we
      support.

      Further details of api.xml and api-c.xml changes:

      + sed converted everything with const attribute (which turned
        out to be *_MATRIX and *_VECTOR arguments).

      + Followed up by looking at language following each *_MATRIX and
        *_VECTOR argument and replace "pointer", "array" or "grid"
        references by "character string", "vector of character strings",
        "vector", or "matrix" as appropriate.

      + sed processed lists of examples to be in standard list form, e.g., a
        blank after every comma, "and" before the last instance, and drop
        the comma when there are only two examples in the list.

      + Systematically used the ascii or UTF-8 adjective as appropriate
        when referring to character strings.

      + Updated the descriptions of PLTRANSFORM_callback arguments in a
        uniform way for plcont, plimagefr, plshades, plshade, plshade1,
        and plvect.  Also, update the description of the
        PLTRANSFORM_callback argument in plstransform.

      + Reviewed all use of void * and PLPointer and replace with
        PL_GENERIC_POINTER (usually) or PL_NC_GENERIC_POINTER (rarely) as
        appropriate.

      + PLFLT * -> PLFLT_NC_SCALAR and reviewed associated text.

      + PLINT * -> PLINT_NC_SCALAR and reviewed associated text.

      + PLBOOL * -> PLBOOL_NC_SCALAR and reviewed associated text.

      + PLUNICODE * -> PLBOOL_NC_SCALAR and reviewed associated text.

      + char * -> PLCHAR_NC_VECTOR and reviewed associated text.

      + C-specific plshade1 and plfsurf3d documentation moved from api.xml
        to api-c.xml.

      + Cross-language plGetCursor documentation moved from api-c.xml to
        api.xml.

      + Tracked down the remaining references to the indirection C
        operator * and reduced those as much as possible using our
        typedef'd types.

      + Tracked down the remaining references to the extended regexp
        '[vV]ectored|[aA]rray|[pP]ointer|[Nn]ull-terminated' and reduced
        those as much as possible.

      + Made C argument types linkable and linked to those types in
        api*.xml for the specific case where the type of argument is
        given.

    The section concerning test results was changed in recognition of the
    fact that konsole (the KDE terminal emulator that uses client-side
    system fonts where glyphs are selected by font-config) yields
    essentially perfect UTF-8 test results for info pages.  This is a huge
    improvement compared to the missing Mandarin, Korean, and Devanagari
    (Hindi script) glyphs and the glyph rendering in the wrong order for some
    CTL languages that you get with xterm (the X terminal emulator that
    uses server-side X fonts without the benefit of font-config).

    Fixed text transform issues in wxWidgets when not using
    wxGraphicsContext transforms

    The wxWidgets driver uses a number of systems to transform text. Some
    wxDCs support transforms, if so these were used. Up until recently
    wxGCDC did not support transforms, but the underlying wxGraphicsContext
    does, so these were used where needed. If neither of these options was
    possible then we just do simple translate and rotate transforms.

    Unfortunately ony the wxGraphicsContext code was regularly checked as
    wxGCDCs are used by wxPLViewer and much other display code.

    In the very recent past (during wxWidgets 3.1 development) wxGCDC
    started supporting wxDC transformations and the plplot driver logic was
    arrange such that they were used. This exposed a bug in the use of those
    transforms. Further investigation revealed a bug in the simple translate
    rotate code, including a logic bug that meant this code was only used
    pre wxWidgets 29.0.2 and a syntax error that meant this code actually
    didn't compile pre wxWidgets 29.0.2!

    This commit fixes the logic and compilation bugs that existed in the use
    of the transformations.

    It also reorders the if statements and the way that the code checks for
    a wxGCDC. This makes it clearer that in the case where wxGCDCs now
    support wxDC transformations it is these transformations that will be
    used.

    It should also be noted that at some point if we bump the minimum
    wxWidgets version to 3.2 (once this version gets released) then we
    should be able to ditch all wxGCDC specific code.

    Code tested on Windows.

    Fix infinite yield issue in wxPLplotDemo

    It turns out that on Linux (I think all systems, not just with remote
    X11 servers) the wxEVT_CREATE event is not triggered until after Show()
    is called. This was causing an infinite loop while the code repeatedly
    called Yield to wait for this event before calling Show().

    Provided two separate windows in the example now showing two ways to do
    this properly. One is using inheritence and having a class which catches
    wxEVT_IDLE events, checks if the window is ready and then does the
    plotting. The second does not use inheritance, but just has to make sure
    that Show() is called, followed by some waiting and Yielding (probably
    only needed for remote X11 servers) before we attempt to do any
    plotting.

    Core library: add to C types that are typedef'd

    The new typedefs are

    typedef PLFLT * PLFLT_NC_FE_POINTER;
    typedef const PLFLT * PLFLT_FE_POINTER;

    That is they are additional typedefs for "PLFLT *" and "const PLFLT *"
    that are reserved for use in the special situation when those types
    are used as pointers to the first element of contiguous potentially
    multi-dimensional arrays.

    Since these changes constitute just a relabelling for this particular
    use case, there should be no effective code changes associated with this
    commit.  Nevertheless, I test it below for typographic errors.

    Add convenience batch file for running the examples under bare Windows

    Tested by: Arjen Markus (arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net)

    Due to the lack of sufficiently popwerful tools in the Windows environment (the Windows powershell might provide the tools that are required, but I do not know enough about it for an implementation) the automated testing on this platform is limited. To help with this I have written a small batch file and a dedicated comparison program.

    The idea is simple: run the examples for the various programming languages and compare the output files. It presumes that the examples have been built already, so it does not test anything else than the build that is present.

    To compare the files I wrote a small dedicated C program - experiments with the diff command from MinGW-w64/MSYS2 failed, as it appears you cannot run such programs outside the MinGW-w64/MSYS2 shell (merely setting the path is not enough).

    To use it: go to the top-most directory holding the built examples (that is, the directory with subdirectories like bindings, examples, dll, ...) and run the script "run_examples_windows.bat". That is it. Redirect the output for later inspection.

    Note: it is a fairly simple script - it assumes that all executable programs whose name start with an "x" are PLplot examples with C equivalents. Some experimental programs are present, however, for instance x01cc.exe, so that the comparison program fails to compare the right files. Ignore the resulting false messages.

    N.B. The ChangeLog consisting of all the commit messages for the ~400
    commits that are included in this release has been reviewed to help
    insure that these release notes mention all the major PLplot
    developments that have occurred for this release.  So virtually all
    sections of these release notes should be ready for release.  However,
    my work on the large documentation update is still in progress so that
    section of these release notes will likely require further revision.

    Made some items clearer in the wxWigdets Demo

    Fix bug with plotting in wxPLplotDemo

    On most systems it seems that when wxWindow::Create() is called that
    triggers a create event, but within the Create() function the event loop
    is checked and the create event is processed immediately and OnCreate()
    is called setting up the wxPLplotstream. This means we can begin using
    the wxPLplotstream immediately after the call to Create().

    However on some systems the create event is not processed immediately.
    This has been observed on some Linux systems but apparently
    identical systems seem to have different behaviour. The cause of this is
    not clear.

    To deal with this we now check the wxPLplotwindow is ready and wait for
    it if not, yielding to allow the create event to be processed. Another
    option might be to catch idle events and each time check the window is
    ready then do the plotting at this point. However this is a more complex
    proceedure and it would partly obfuscate what should be a simple
    example.

    Added a function to check if the window is ready to accept plot
    commands.

    This function calls GetStream() to get a pointer to the wxPLplotstream
    and checks if this pointer is NULL as a method for checking if
    everything is ready to accept plot commands. This method is then used
    internally in a few locations to check if things are ready in OnMouse
    and OnPaint. Performing these checks implies that it is possible for a
    paint or mouse event to be generated before a create event. I'm not sure
    if this is the case, but the wxWidgets docs are a bit vague so there is
    no harm in using the checks.

    Use /dev/urandom in preference to /dev/random in wxWidgets driver.

    The wxWidgets driver needs to create a random name for a memory map to
    avoid name clashes with concurrent instances. The seed for the random
    number generator was created from /dev/random, however this blocks and
    caused up to a 1-15 second delay in some instances while waiting for
    entropy. Swap to using /dev/urandom when possible which is not as
    random, but suits our needs and does not block.

    Build system: fix build bug for (default) -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=OFF and also fix install bug

    For my recent fix for the combination case of (-DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON
    -DPLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC=OFF) I forgot to test the
    -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=OFF case which also had some build-system errors.
    Those errors are now fixed as well as another recently introduced
    build-system error where the install target failed because the generated
    header, bindings/wxwidgets/wxPLplot_nanosec.h in the build tree, was
    incorrectly identified has being in the source tree.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    to test all combinations of PLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT and
    PLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC for the wxwidgets device and binding.  There were no
    obvious, configuration, build, or run-time issues with any of these
    tests.

    Build system: fix build bug for combination -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON and (default) -DPLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC=OFF

    I needed to tweak the Boolean logic for setting the
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property for the wxwidgets target and
    (when ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS OFF) the plplot target.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building (both for the cases when
    ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=ON and OFF) the x01c, wxwidgets (when
    ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=ON), and wxPLViewer and test_wxPLplotDemo targets and then running

    time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np; echo "done x01c"; time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np;echo "done x01c"

    Unfortunately, the pause issue is still there in all cases, and
    mousing around (to increase entropy to test Phil's hypothesis for this
    bug) does not appear to make any difference at all.

    But at least the build bug reported by Pedro has been fixed!

    Implement wxwidgets device driver debug output using the PLPLOT_wxLogDebug macro

    I used the same useful PLPLOT_wxLogDebug macro that was just implemented
    to output wxwidgets debug information, but complications (since the wxwidgets device driver
    does not link to the plplotwxwidgets library) were to conditionally
    add the bindings/wxwidgets/wxPLplot_nanosec.cpp code to
    the source code for the wxwidgets device driver (or the plplot library
    if ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS is false) and #include the configured header
    bindings/wxwidgets/wxPLplot_nanosec.h in the build tree.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by using the cmake options

    -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON -DPLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC=ON

    (the second one of those options is experimental and also optional) to
    configure the debug output from the PLPLOT_wxLogDebug macro. I made a
    number of tests by inserting PLPLOT_wxLogDebug(<some message>); statements
    throughout the device driver code to see if I could pin down the cause
    of the long pause.

    I built and tested each of those results as follows:

    make wxwidgets
    time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np; echo "done x01c"; time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np;echo "done x01c"

    Until for the last such test (where this commit includes all the uses
    of PLPLOT_wxLogDebug) where I got an inexplicable result.

    The partial output from the start of the execution of x01c for the
    second time was as follows:

    PLplot library version: 5.11.1
    03:21:18: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838153041939051: plD_init_wxwidgets(): enter

    03:21:19: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838153517870818: SetupMemoryMap(): enter
    03:21:32: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838166471100796: SetupMemoryMap(): mapName start
    03:21:32: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838166471176607: SetupMemoryMap(): mapName done
    03:21:32: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838166471205300: SetupMemoryMap(): m_outputMemoryMap.create call
    03:21:32: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1838166471277077: SetupMemoryMap(): m_outputMemoryMap.create done

    Clearly, there is a dramatic large 13 second pause between where
    SetupMemoryMap() is entered and it starts to determine mapName. But
    the inexplicable part is if you look at the source code there is
    trivial executable code code between those two uses of the
    PLPLOT_wxLogDebug macro, and there is nothing done between the two
    that is related to wxwidgets at all!  So fundamentally it looks like
    something completely different code is freezing anything to do with
    wxwidgets so either execution of the SetupMemoryMap routine itself is
    suspended or else execution of wxLogDebug (which is called by the
    PLPLOT_wxLogDebug macro) is suspended for 13 seconds.  Why?

Date:   Sun Dec 18 20:44:22 2016 -0800

    Upgrade debug output for wxwidgets using the PLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT and PLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC CMake options.

    Implement the option PLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT which defaults to OFF.
    However, when the user specifies ON, then
    debug output is generated for wxwidgets device driver, binding, and example
    wherever the developers have used the macro

        PLPLOT_wxLogDebug(<some string>);

    in the code.

    N.B. When the default OFF option is used, that macro is #define'd but empty, and
    therefore there is no code that is compiled from the above use of
    the macro and therefore no wxwidgets debug output for this case.

    Implement the option PLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC which is only meaningful if
    PLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT is ON.  If both these options are ON, then a
    nanosec time stamp is applied to the debug message that is output.
    However, PLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC defaults to OFF (so that nanosec time stamp
    is not applied) because this option is completely experimental, i.e.,
    it will introduce build errors if the user's system does not properly
    support the clock_gettime function which is a POSIX option so
    clock_gettime is mostly available only on Linux.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) for 3 configuration cases with the following cmake command-line
    options:

    (1) -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON -DPLPLOT_WX_NANOSEC=ON
    (2) -DPLPLOT_WX_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON
    (3) neither of these options

    The result for (1) when building the test_wxPLplotDemo target was

    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113138508376: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113147285531: frame->Create
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113151908731: wxPLplotwindow::Show
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113151958780: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113172019557: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113172092596: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    19:00:38: Debug: nanosecs since epoch = 1808113181701454: Plot()

    The result for (2) when building the test_wxPLplotDemo target was

    20:38:39: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    20:38:39: Debug: frame->Create
    20:38:39: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::Show
    20:38:39: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    20:38:39: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate
    20:38:39: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    20:38:39: Debug: Plot()

    And the result for (3) when building the test_wxPLplotDemo target was
    no debug output at all.

    I find these wxwidgets debug output results (i.e., no debug output at
    all by default) completely satisfactory for the release, although I
    will likely be deploying additional usage of

    PLPLOT_wxLogDebug(<some string>);

    to try and track down the long pause bug.

    -dev wxwidgets and wxPLViewer: remove debugging output from PLMemoryMap::create and PLMemoryMap::close

    This debugging output in PLMemoryMap::create and PLMemoryMap::close
    was useful for determining that (a) there were
    no shared memory leaks being generated by this code, and (b) the long
    pause issue was created elsewhere than these two methods.

    However, this debugging output has served its purpose and was
    implemented in a clumsy manner (which I can say because it was mine)
    which created preprocessor directives all over the code making it
    virtually unreadable.  So as a matter of code cleanup and consistent
    with the philosophy of removing all debug output from releases, I have
    completely removed this debugging output implementation for these two
    routines, and if I ever have to reinstate something similar, I will
    likely implement it in another way altogether.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the targets x01c, wxwidgets, wxPLViewer and
    running

    time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np; echo "done x01c"; time examples/c/x01c -dev wxwidgets -np;echo "done x01c"

    with the PLMemoryMap::create and PLMemoryMap::close debug output gone
    as expected.  However, there is the usual result of this example where
    there is a long pause (typically 5 to 10 seconds) some time in the
    initial phases of the start of the second time x01c is run, but (from
    previous evidence from the just-removed debug output) some time before
    PLMemoryMap::create is called by -dev wxwidgets).

    These preliminary release notes have not been finalized yet because
    the preliminary ChangeLog of commit messages for this release has only
    been reviewed for topics to include in these release notes up to the
    first NAGFOR-related commit.  Also, the section on the documentation

    wxwidgets binding: workaround fix for delayed OnCreate event

    Add a workaround fix for cases where frame->Create does not trigger an
    OnCreate() event before the Plot() in test_wxPLplotDemo. The solution
    is to create the stream in a overidden Show() method, that is always
    called on window creation.

    Tested by: Pedro Vicente <pedro.vicente@rhw9121.star1.nesdis.noaa.gov>
    on CentOS Linux with wxwidgets3.1 built from source with the following
    results from building the test_wxPLplotDemo target:

    13:16:18: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    13:16:18: Debug: frame->Create
    13:16:18: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::Show
    13:16:18: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    13:16:19: Debug: Plot()
    13:16:19: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate
    13:16:19: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream

    The above debug sequence shows that the stream is
    valid before the plot is made.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) with the system version of wxwidgets-3.0.2 with
    the following results from building the test_wxPLplotDemo target:

    23:41:12: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    23:41:12: Debug: frame->Create
    23:41:12: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::Show
    23:41:12: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    23:41:12: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate
    23:41:12: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::CreateStream
    23:41:12: Debug: Plot()

    In this case, Plot() occurs in a different order but the net effect is
    the same as Pedro's case; an OnCreate() event occurs before Plot().
    Furthermore, the plot result on this system looks the same as it
    did before this fix (as expected from the above event sequence).

    wxwidgets binding: insert debug messages

    Add debug messages that show sequence of events for a bug that happens
    on some but not all Linux distributions with wxwidgets3.0/3.1.  The
    cause is that frame->Create does not always trigger an OnCreate()
    event on time before the Plot() call.

    Tested by: Pedro Vicente <pedro.vicente@rhw9121.star1.nesdis.noaa.gov>
    on CentOS Linux with wxwidgets3.1 built from source with the following
    results from building the test_wxPLplotDemo target:

    11:09:13: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    11:09:13: Debug: frame->Create
    11:09:13: Debug: pls NULL
    11:09:13: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate

    Clearly this demonstrates the bug with the OnCreate() event happening
    too late.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) with the system version of wxwidgets-3.0.2 with
    the following results from building the test_wxPLplotDemo target:

    23:09:34: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::wxPLplotwindow
    23:09:34: Debug: frame->Create
    23:09:34: Debug: wxPLplotwindow::OnCreate
    23:09:34: Debug: Plot()

    Clearly in this case the OnCreate() event happens on time in contrast
    with Pedro's result.  This demonstrates the bug is platform-dependent
    where because timing might be involved, platform should be interpreted
    as generally as possible including the hardware/OS version as well as
    wxwidgets and gtk+ software.  The above results were without
    VirtualBox, but in addition all of Pedro's tests failed on a
    VirtualBox setup he was using where host was a Windows OS and the
    guests were various Linux distributions with system versions of
    wxwidgets. Pedro also got a bad test for a non-VirtualBox Ubuntu
    distro with wxwidgets was built from source while Phil got a good test
    for a non-VirtualBox Ubuntu distro for system wxwidgets.  So there are
    no clear patterns here.

    Build system: Implement version check on libharu = libhpdf

    Generally speaking, libharu versions < 2.3.0 have a bug (fixed in
    2.3.0) where they do not support largish fonts such as occur in our
    example 24. Therefore, our build system now implements a version
    check for libharu version >= 2.3.0, and only if that check
    is passed is PLD_pdf allowed to be ON.

    Thanks to Hazen for suggesting this version check to deal with the
    several recent dashboard results where test_c_pdf failed on example
    24.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by attempting to configure against libharu version
    2.2.1 (which was rejected as expected) and then libharu version
    2.3.0 (which was accepted as expected).  For the latter case,
    I built the test_c_pdf target, and build and run went well while
    spot checks using a pdf image viewer, e.g.

    gv examples/test_examples_output_dir/x24c.pdf

    showed the pdf device was slightly better quality in graphics than our
    psc device and roughly the same quality in text (i.e., extremely
    limited selection of glyphs available).  This was the first time I had
    checked this device linked against version 2.3.0 of libharu. (Previous
    checks were linked against a patched version 2.2.1 of libharu.) All
    seems well with this version of libharu so I feel comfortable with
    forcing those interested in using the pdf device driver
    to use this (latest) version of libharu.

    Build system: Fix test_python_psc dependency issue

    Recent dashboards (e.g.,
    <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=PLplot_git&date=2016-12-11>)
    that did not enable Tk were showing CMake errors with the following
    message:

    CMake Error at examples/CMakeLists.txt:668 (add_dependencies):
      The dependency target "plplot_widgetmodule" of target "test_python_psc"
      does not exist.

    I was also able to replicate this issue by enabling Python but not Tk.
    The cause was some bad logic that indiscrimately added the
    plplot_widgetmodule to the TARGETS_examples_python GLOBAL property
    in examples/python/CMakeLists.txt even for cases where the
    plplot_widgetmodule target was not built.  This commit fixes
    that logic.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running cmake with python enabled and either
    tk enabled or disabled without CMake error.  In the former case
    I also built the test_pytkdemo target and was able to operate
    the resulting pytkdemo GUI that was launched by that test without
    issues.

    Build system: Improve error message when pkg-config results are inconsistent with CMake library finding

    The pkg-config CMake module typically delivers (along with other
    information) a list of link flags including many libraries specified
    in the -L... -lbasename form. We translate that format for libraries
    into actual full pathnames for libraries using the find_library
    command.  This commit improves the error message when some subset of
    the libraries cannot be found.  We thank Laurent Berger for drawing
    this issue to our attention.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by temporarily renaming the pango-1.0 libraries so
    CMake cannot find them.  Here is the resulting WARNING messages
    which are substantially more informative to the user than
    what was delivered for this case before:

    --   Found pango, version 1.36.8
    -- WARNING: Library inconsistency detected.  Your pkg-config files claim certain libraries are present, but CMake cannot find them.
    -- The unfound library basenames are as follows:
    -- pango-1.0
    -- Some library installation and/or adjustment of find-related environment variables or corresponding CMake variables will be required before CMake will be able to find these libraries.
    -- cmake_link_flags WARNING: (original link flags) = -lpango-1.0;-lgobject-2.0;-lglib-2.0

    Build system: Bump non-Linux minimum version from 3.3.2 to 3.6.2

    At this time, Cygwin provides CMake-3.6.2, MinGW-w64/MSYS2 provides
    CMake-3.7.0, Fink provides CMake-3.7.1, MacPorts provides CMake-3.7.1,
    and HomeBrew provides CMake-3.7.1.

    So adopting a minimum version of 3.6.2 should provide no hardships for any
    users of the above non-Linux distributions.

    I plan to bump the minimum version for Linux distributions to 3.7.x in
    6 months or so, but for now it remains at 3.0.2 (the version provided
    by Debian Jessie).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) using

    time (nice -19 scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_submit_dashboard yes --cmake_command /usr/bin/cmake)

    i.e., there were no constraints limiting this test other than
    specifying the Debian Jessie system version of cmake which is 3.0.2.
    There were no obvious configure, build, or run-time errors, and there
    were no PostScript difference regressions.

    In addition to this good result for 3.0.2, my recent good
    comprehensive test results for PLplot on Linux were for CMake-3.7.0.
    So these tests pretty much cover the entire range of CMake versions
    that we can use on Linux.  Of course, once Arjen finishes his (largely
    unlimited) comprehensive test on Cygwin using cmake-3.6.2, and
    similarly on MinGW-w64/MSYS2 using the latest cmake version there
    (currently 3.7.0) these good conclusions about what versions of CMake
    we support should be strengthened even more.

    N.B. these tests did not include the recent commits concerning wxwidgets
    changes.  So those changes will have to be comprehensively tested later.

    Fixed problem with rotated wxWidgets text

    When text was rotated and there was a style change mid line the text was
    rendered in the wrong position. Basically for a 90 degree rotatio the x
    and y translations relative to the text origin were reversed.

    A similar but more subtle issue was that text with newlines was also not
    aligned properly as it was assumed that the scale for converting between
    plplot units and pixels was the same which only occured when the device
    context was square.

    These problems were fixed by passing an origin through the function
    calls and passing coordinates relative to that origin. This meant that
    the relative positions got correctly rotated.

    qt device driver: drop use of automoc

    This was an example of automoc overkill. All the relevant
    automoc-generated symbols are already available and exported from the
    plplotqt library which the qt shared object links to.  So it was
    redundant to regenerate those symbols again with automoc for the qt
    shared object, and although the result worked on Linux it appeared to
    be associated with build problems on Cygwin.  So my hope is that by
    removing this redundancy (which also works fine on Linux, see below),
    the Cygwin problems associated with the build of qt will disappear.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_c_qtwidget target with no
    obvious configure-, build-, or run-time issues.

    Furthermore,

    ldd -r drivers/qt.so |& less ,

    nm --defined-only --extern-only --demangle drivers/qt.so ,

    and

    nm --undefined-only --demangle drivers/qt.so |less

    all gave the expected (good) results.

    N.B. testing on Cygwin is requested to make sure this fix and a prior
    similar fix for pyqt4 work well on that platform.

    This file is used by the check_libtclmatrix_capabilities target for
    an exact comparison with pltcl results that exercise the libtclmatrix
    capabilities.  These pltcl results do have some trailing blanks
    so those must be preserved in test_tclmatrix.out as well.

    (Debian Jessie) by running the modified

    scripts/remove_trailing_blanks.sh

    No files were changed as a result.  In particular, test_tclmatrix.out

    typedef char *                PLCHAR_NC_VECTOR;
    typedef PLFLT *               PLFLT_NC_VECTOR;

    // Pointers to mutable 2-dimensional matrices:
    typedef char **               PLCHAR_NC_MATRIX;
    typedef PLFLT **              PLFLT_NC_MATRIX;

    These typedefs are used throughout plplot.h to self-document arguments
    which previously had an ambiguous type (e.g., char *) that could be
    interpreted either as an array or returned value.

    Currently, these new types are not used anywhere else within PLplot but I plan to
    use them for DocBook documentation purposes for this release and
    post-release I plan to propagate them to other parts of the PLplot
    code.

    We drop the use of PL_GENERIC_POINTER outside of plplot.h (which
    involved changing two lines of code in fonts/stndfont.c), and we
    temporarily drop the const attribute from that typedef.  That allows
    us to replace PLPointer where appropriate with PL_GENERIC_POINTER
    within include.h as a self-documenting argument type indicating that
    generic pointer argument _should have_ a const attribute without
    actually making that backwards-incompatible change, yet.

    In sum, although these changes are intrusive code changes for
    plplot.h, they are meant to be equivalent to no actual code changes,
    i.e., they are designed for self-documentation purposes for now within
    plplot.h, but the plan is to propagate the use of these typedefs throughout PLplot
    after the release to spread that self documentation.

    Since these changes were intrusive, they were heavily tested.  See
    two commits after this one for the details.

    wxwidgets: insert more debugging output into code

    This time we use

    +#define PLMemoryMap_DEBUG
    +//#undef PLMemoryMap_DEBUG

    in drivers/wxwidgets_comms.h to keep all this debugging noise in the output until we solve this.  But for the
    release must remember to reverse the sense of the commenting out done
    above.

    Note this debug output shows what naively appears to me (because there may be an
    easy explanation I just don't understand due to lack of C++ skills) to be
    a deadloock of some kind which I will discuss on list.

    wxwidgets device driver: #undef and use the PLMemoryMap_DEBUG macro

    Because PLMemoryMap_DEBUG is #undef'd there is no debug output
    for PLMemoryMap, but a future change to #define PLMemoryMap_DEBUG
    will generate a lot of useful defbug output.

    (Debian Jessie) by building and running tests for this commit and
    also a local but uncommitted change where PLMemoryMap_DEBUG
    was #defined.  All results were as expected for the two cases.

    wxwidgets device driver: insert some useful debugging output

    The resulting debugging output has been discussed recently on the plplot-devel
    mailing list.  It allowed significant narrowing down of the source of
    the long idle wait times that occur for -dev wxwidgets, but that
    narrowing down process is not finished  yet.

    Build system bug fix: Set USINGDLL macro for automoc-generated source code

    The USINGDLL macro must be set in the shared libraries case in
    order for visibility of symbols to be implemented correctly.

    Our previous method of specifying this macro set the the source-code
    property COMPILE_FLAGS (or at least one part of that space-separated
    list) to "-DUSINGDLL".  But that method fails on automoc-generated
    source code (and possibly other generated source code).  The answer is
    to set the target property COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to USINGDLL (which
    applies to all source code for the target whether generated or not).
    This fix (and also cleanup in style) is an intrusive build-system
    change where for libraries this logic is now all centralized with the
    set_library_properties function.  As a result of this fix, all
    instances of "DUSINGDLL" are now gone from our build-system logic and
    either replaced centrally or on-the-spot for modules and executables
    by the above COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property.

    This fix allowed us to drop the previous automoc-related workarounds
    for the plplot_pyqt4 and plplot_pyqt5 targets that had been applied
    previously which was to regenerate automoc results for those targets.
    Those workarounds worked on Linux but were causing undefined symbol
    problems on Cygwin (and possibly other platforms).  So it is
    anticipated this fix will solve that Cygwin issue.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    The above build system change was intrusive, and a lot of previous
    commits were only partially tested.  So note there are no constraining
    options used for this script run, i.e., all PLplot components and all
    major configurations were tested by it for both the interactive and
    non-interactive cases.  The result was near perfect with no obvious
    configure-, build-, or run-time issues.  The only exception to this is
    noted and discussed below. Furthermore, there were no PostScript
    regressions (i.e., the PostScript difference report was perfect other
    than the long-standing ocaml issues) and no "ldd -r" issues.

    The only issue for this test was
    that at one point (after the test_c_ntk target started building, but
    that is not necessarily the one causing the issue because of the -j4
    jumbling of results) PLplot generated ~5

    PLPLOT ERROR, ABORTING OPERATION

    messages from a C (or C++) call to

    plabort( "<command_name>: Please call plinit first" )

    for several different command_names that were executed for the
    interactive testing case and the static build.  But without an actual
    error exit, and a subsequent run of the appropriate test_interactive
    target could not replicate the issue (perhaps because I hit GUI
    buttons in a different order?  As a result it is extremely difficult
    to find the source of this issue.

    The above "PLPLOT ERROR" string is looked for and a specific error
    exit is taken for most of the results generated in plplot_test except
    for

    plplot_test/test_octave_interactive.sh.in

    But none of those interactive octave examples are currently exercised.
    So I conclude this issue occurred for a different type of interactive
    test target that is not coverered by plplot_test.  But since I could
    not identify the source of the issue I am documenting it here (in case
    I see it ever again) and moving on.

    Build system bug fix: Set installed rpath for the plplotf95 library

    This bit of build-system logic for the USE_RPATH=ON case was
    inadvertently dropped when creating the new Fortran bindings.
    Reinstate it.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_ocaml=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    (This test also checks the recent fix to this script to drop
    dllplplot_stubs.so from the ldd -r reports.)

    There were no (bad) results from

    grep  'undefined symbol' $(find ../comprehensive_test_disposeable -name "*ldd.out")

    like there were before for (the now suppressed) dllplplot_stubs.so
    case and the libplplotf95.so case.

    In addition there were no obvious run-time or PostScript difference
    issues from

    grep -i "error" ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out

    and

    grep -B1 -A3 "Missing examples" ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out |less

    Comprehensive test script: Improved collection of environment variables

    Make the grep selection of environment variable from printenv more specific to avoid
    collecting, say both

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=

    and

    MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    (which actually was reported recently in a report tarball) when for
    PLplot testing report purposes we only need to know the contents of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON" --do_test_noninteractive no --do_ctest no --do_test_traditional_install_tree no --do_test_interactive no --do_test_build_tree no --do_test_install_tree no

    i.e., a vacuous test other than collecting environment variables and a
    listing of the files in ../comprehensive_test_disposable when this
    test is completed.  The collected environment variables were fine (and
    for the record so was the listing file under these unprecedented test

    Python examples: Rename xw??.py modules to x??.py

    This commit completes the topic consisting of namespacing the
    maintained set of Python example modules (named xw??.py at that time)
    so they work well both noninteractively and with pyqtdemo, dumping the
    unmaintained set of Python example modules (named x??.py at that
    time), and renaming the xw??.py set as x??.py.

    After the renaming was completed I searched our entire source tree
    as follows:

    find . -type f |grep -v .git |xargs grep xw |grep -vE 'xwin|wxwidgets' |less

    and checked through those results for anything relevant to the xw??.py
    examples.  As far as I know, the only references left are historical
    documents, e.g., old changelogs, and the python chapter of our DocBook
    documentation.  However, that chapter is so out of date it needs to be
    completely rewritten so I left the xw??.py references there to be
    dealt with during that urgently needed rewrite.

    I also searched our entire source tree as follows:

    software@raven> find . -type f |grep -v .git |xargs grep 'from *plplot *import'
    ./bindings/python/Plframe.py:from plplot import *
    ./examples/python/pytkdemo:from plplot import *

    to demonstrate that non-namespaced imports of plplot still exist.
    However, I don't have time/energy to deal with these now so I leave
    changing these last two instances to namespaced versions an exercise
    for the (distant?) future.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running the following comprehensive tests
    (which also test our recent build-system bug fixes):

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DPLD_extqt=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_qt=ON -DENABLE_cxx=ON -DENABLE_python=ON -DENABLE_pyqt4=ON -DENABLE_pyqt5=ON")

    The above test showed good configure, build, and GUI manipulation for
    qt_example and pyqt4_example interactive results (demonstrating the
    previous external devices fix works) and good configure, build, and
    PostScript differences for the noninteractive Python results
    (demonstrating the current name change is working well for
    noninteractive testing.)

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_xwin=ON -DPLD_tk=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_tcl=ON -DENABLE_tk=ON -DENABLE_itcl=ON -DENABLE_itk=ON -DENABLE_python=ON" --do_test_noninteractive no --do_ctest no --do_test_traditional_install_tree no

    The above test showed good configure, build, and GUI manipulation
    results for the Tcl examples (demonstrating the x02.tcl fix is working
    well for all these different Tcl/Tk tests).  They also showed good
    configure, build, and GUI manipulation results for pytkdemo.  For all
    tests I randomly pushed the buttons for the various examples to
    generate them in random order, and I did not notice any issue at all
    with cross-talk between the examples showing the restore capabilities
    we have created within the (newly renamed) x??.py modules are working
    well. Note that no pytkdemo results are possible for the static
    library case since Python and therefore this GUI are automatically
    turned off for that case, but for what we could test (the build-tree
    and installed-examples tree cases and for the remaining two major
    configurations [shared libraries + dynamic device, shared libraries +
    nondynamic devices]) all was well.

    For the first comprehensive test I forgot to check the ldd -r results
    but the the last comprehensive test, the following test showed
    there were no missing symbols _in any_ of the shared objects that we
    build.

    grep -i "symbol not found" $(find ../comprehensive_test_disposeable -name "*ldd.out")

    Build system: Fix linking issues

    For the plplot_widgetmodule shared object used by pytkdemo, the ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS
    OFF linking case only works if -dev tk code is incorporated into libplplot.
    So add some "AND (ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS OR PLD_tk)" Boolean logic to only
    build the plplot_widgetmodule shared object and the test_pytkdemo target
    that depends on it only for this (correct) case.

    Add list of external devices to interactive devices to determine
    <driver>_targets in test system targets that are enabled in the
    examples subdirectory.  This change makes sure that qt_targets and
    cairo_targets are correctly calculated for the case where only the
    extqt form and not the interactive form of the qt or cairo devices
    is enabaled.

    Also, I took this opportunity to allow test_tk and test_interactive
    general interactive targets to depend on test_pytkdemo since that GUI
    has become so reliable now.

    Bug fix for TclSup.py: Allow the possibility that list of file devices is empty

    This bug in TclSup.py was discovered for the case where the cmake options

    -DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_xwin=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON
    -DENABLE_tcl=ON -DENABLE_tk=ON -DENABLE_itcl=ON -DENABLE_itk=ON
    -DENABLE_python=ON

    were used and the test_pytkdemo target was built.  (The pytkdemo
    GUI's operation depends on TclSup.py working properly, and before
    this fix an empty list of file devices was causing python errors
    during the GUI startup.)

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) using the above cmake options and
    building test_pyqtdemo without any build issues or GUI running
    issues (although I did not try the GUI button to
    store results to a file device since there are none of those
    for the above cmake options, so a graceful escape from that
    situation will likely take more programming effort if somebody
    is interested in further developing this GUI).

    Removed all the x[0-9][0-9].py versions of the standard Python example modules

    These x[0-9][0-9].py versions (which were the historical basis of the
    current well-maintained and expanded set of xw[0-9][0-9].py example
    modules) were only kept around because the pytkdemo Python +
    Plframe/Tcl/Tk used them, but pytkdemo has now been changed to use the
    xw[0-9][0-9].py versions and nothing else in our source tree refers to
    these x[0-9][0-9].py versions.  Also these x[0-9][0-9].py versions are
    not well-maintained. So there is no reason to keep these unmaintained
    versions around any longer.

    Python + Plframe/Tk/Tcl GUI: large update

    Changed pytkdemo (which demonstrates this GUI) to add examples 0, 9,
    and 18 to the GUI and change the standard example modules that were
    imported from the x??.py versions to the xw??.py versions.  The x??.py
    versions had historically served as the starting basis for the xw??.py
    versions, but the latter had been greatly expanded, modernized, and
    maintained while the former were essentially unmaintained.  Thus, the
    only reason to keep the x??.py versions around was because the xw??.py
    versions had originally been changed to using no plplot namespace (a
    historical error by yours truly because I didn't understand Python
    very well way back when) so could not be called from pytkdemo.  That
    historical error has now been rectified allowing the present change to
    pytkdemo so it now imports the xw??.py versions of the standard
    example modules.

    The modernized/expanded standard example modules required large
    changes to Plframe.py to support the additional PLplot API used in
    those examples including all the PLplot constants and a substantial
    number of PLplot functions which had not been supported before.

    N.B. pytkdemo currently does not display examples 14, 15, 17, and
    19-33. If that demo was modified to add in some or all of those
    missing examples more PLplot functions would have to be added to
    Plframe.py.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_pytkdemo target and
    clicking on each of the subset of examples that are enabled
    in that GUI (examples 0 through 18 excluding 14, 15, and 17).

    Those examples looked find with no observable cross-talk between them
    except for one intermittent colour issue which is when I clicked on
    example 0 through 3 in that exact order, example 3 turned up with the
    wrong colours.  But I could not reproduce the problem reliably so I
    suspect these intermittent colour issues are the result of some subtle
    memory management issue.

    In sum, pytkdemo now has a new lease on life with very few issues
    compared to what it had before with the x??.py version of the
    standard example modules.  And this commit prepares the way
    for removing the x??.py version of the standard examples in
    the next commit.

    Remove plplot_test/test_single_python.sh script

    This bash script historically was used to run a single Python example.  It
    had fallen into disrepair (it would not work properly on standard
    examples 14, 17 and 31, and also it needed a fixup to work with the
    namespaced version of the xw?? modules we have now), and was located
    in an awkward directory in the source tree from which it would have
    had to be run from examples/python in the build tree.  Also this
    script has been completely superseded by the examples/python/x??
    Python scripts and is referred to by no other script or file (except
    for historical data) within our source tree. Therefore, deep-six this
    script.

    Python examples: Convert pythondemos.py to namespaced form

    In this example replaced all instances of

    from plplot import *

    with

    import plplot as <somenamespace>

    where somenamespace is typically "w".  Then edited this example
    further to use the now required (because of the above form of import
    statement) namespaced version (e.g., w.plparseopts rather than
    plparseopts and w.PL_PARSE_FULL rather than PL_PARSE_FULL) to refer to
    all plplot function calls and data.

    I also took this opportunity to remove import of the
    plplot_py_demos module and also removed the corresponding
    file plplot_py_demos.py which contained only

    from plplot import *
    from numpy import *

    This change avoids the non-namespaced form of import statement
    for the plplot module.  And with regard to numpy, I
    now use "from numpy import *" where needed.

    Within pythondemos.py I now import the restore module and call
    restore.main(w) to do the required return to default of the chosen
    cmap0 colour index between each of the examples.  (By avoiding this
    index change within the xw??.py modules, we avoid generating spurious
    differences with the C standard examples.) At some point in the future
    I may do other restoration to default via the restore module, but for
    now, I leave that to individual xw??.py examples following the
    restoration model used by the Tcl examples (to avoid
    cross-contamination issues between them).  Note, that preliminary runs
    of pythondemos.py (and also pytkdemo while converting it over to use
    of the xw??.py modules, see next commit) showed a lot of
    cross-contamination issues that had to be dealt with by restoring to
    default in each of the xw??.py modules where some command within the
    example was changing PLplot to a non-default state.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building all the Python example prerequisite
    targets (_plplotcmodule_fixed and python_examples), the Chloe_file
    target (required by example 20), and some interactive device driver
    target [I picked the cairo target so that the xcairo device would be
    accessible]).  Afterward, I changed directory to examples/python
    (required by the location of Chloe.pgm) and ran

    ./pythondemons.py

    with no obvious cross-contamination or any other issue.

    Python examples: Convert xMN + xwMN.py python scripts and modules to namespaced form

    (The xMN form is always a script that imports the corresponding xwMN
    module, but xwMN.py is also a script for MN = 14, 17, and 31).

    In these script and module pairs corresponding to a standard example,
    I replaced all instances of

    from plplot import *

    with

    import plplot as <somenamespace>

    where somenamespace is typically "w".  Then edited these examples
    further to use the now required (because of the above form of import
    statement) namespaced version (e.g., w.plparseopts rather than
    plparseopts and w.PL_PARSE_FULL rather than PL_PARSE_FULL) to refer to
    all plplot function calls and data.

    In anticipation of the next commit concerning the pythondemos.py
    script to run all Python standard examples at once, I took this
    opportunity to remove known sources of cross-contamination of one
    example with another by restoring defaults (other than choice of
    current cmap0 index which must be restored another way to avoid
    creating spurious differences with the corresponding C results).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_noninteractive target.
    No build, run-time, or PostScript difference issues were encountered.

    Tests: Added test_pytkdemo target

    This target runs the pytkdemo example which exercises all the x??.py
    forms of the Python examples using the Tcl/Tk plframe approach that is
    briefly described in examples/python/README.pythondemos.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_pytkdemo target from scratch
    (just after cmake was run in an empty build tree).  Via the
    dependencies of that target all prerequisites for running pytkdemo are
    built, and then pytkdemo is run.  That modified Tkinter GUI appears to
    work well outside of some bugs in the x??.py examples which have
    essentially gone unmaintained since ~2000 essentially because pytkdemo
    is the only way to run these examples. (N.B. the xw??.py form of the
    examples can be run with pure python independent of Tkinter and the
    Tcl/Tk plframe approach, and are well maintained.)

    Build system: Fix stale cached variable bug in determining correct HAS_LIBQHULL_INCLUDE value

    If HAS_LIBQHULL_INCLUDE was ON as a result of the first cmake run, for any subsequent
    run the cached variable QHULL_INCLUDE_DIR would be true and HAS_LIBQHULL_INCLUDE would
    (incorrectly) be set to OFF as a result.  The fix was to look for both
    forms of header with one command and store the result in the cached
    variable QHULL_INCLUDE_FILE, and then parse that cached result to see if
    it was the libqhull form or not.  Subsequent runs would skip the find
    (because the cached value would show that had already been done) and
    continue to parse that result the same way.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    running cmake twice and looking at the QHULL-related results for the
    case when the libqhull form of header was present and also the case
    when it was not.  In all cases got the expected results for
    HAS_LIBQHULL_INCLUDE which were consistent between cmake runs.

    CTest: Implement PLPLOT_BUILDNAME_SUFFIX and use this capability to improve labelling of dashboards submitted by comprehensive_test.sh

    The CTest module typically calculates the BUILDNAME as <os>-<compiler>,
    e.g., Linux-c++.  I have implemented an option to add a suffix to that name
    to help users label the various kinds of PLplot builds in more detail.  The logic
    I use for this is

    set(BUILDNAME ${BUILDNAME}${PLPLOT_BUILDNAME_SUFFIX})

    So if the user specifies the cmake option

    -DPLPLOT_BUILDNAME_SUFFIX:STRING="-(shared library + dynamic devices)"

    then if the usual name string would have been "Linux-c++" then the
    actual name string used to identify the build for a dashboard
    will be "Linux-c++-(shared library + dynamic devices)"

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_submit_dashboard yes --do_test_interactive no --do_test_noninteractive no --do_test_install_tree no --do_test_traditional_install_tree no

    The resulting three dashboards at
    <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=PLplot_git&date=2016-11-29> are
    labelled appropriately for the three principal build configurations
    tested by the above script options so this BUILDNAME suffix capability seems to be
    working correctly.

    tree for just our shared library/dynamic devices configuration.) The
    resulting dashboard at

    Comprehensive test script: Implement the --do_submit_dashboard option

    Because of privacy concerns, we make this option opt-in (i.e., the
    default value is no).  The reason for this is the dashboards collected
    and published at <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=PLplot_git> by
    this option contain essentially all details of each ctest run (e.g., how many
    cpu's does your computer have).  So some users may prefer not to use
    this option for that reason.  Note, if the user specifies yes for this
    option they are also specifically warned of the publication of
    complete details of their ctest results, and they have a chance to abort
    the comprehensive test at that point if they so desire.

    We also took this opportunity to make the order in which
    the script options are documented, processed, and summarized
    consistent throughout the script.  We also made that order
    more logical in a few cases.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_submit_dashboard yes --do_test_interactive no --do_test_noninteractive no --do_test_install_tree no --do_test_traditional_install_tree no

    (which because of the extra options, ends up running just "make -j4"
    and "ctest -j4 -D Experimental" in the build tree for our 3 major
    configurations).  As expected 3 dashboards containing these ctest
    results were submitted to and showed up at
    <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=PLplot_git>.  So it appears,
    this script update is a complete success.  However, for those
    published dashboards, I noticed that the examples_compare test
    exceeded the default limit of 1024 bytes for successfull tests so I
    plan to raise that limit to 10240 bytes in a forthcoming commit.

    Implement submission of dashboards to the my.cdash.org cdash server

    The new CTestConfig.cmake file was provided by my.cdash.org to
    facilitate submitting dashboards (defined to be essentially the complete
    set of information associated with a particular ctest run) to the new
    "PLplot_git" project I created at my.cdash.org. Note the "ctest -D
    Experimental " command I used below to test this project, can be
    executed by anybody to create a dashboard and send it to the
    "PLplot_git" project.  However, since this is a free service (provided
    by Kitware) there is a limit of a total of 10 dashboard submissions
    per day.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running the following commands:

    cmake -DBUILD_TEST=ON ....
    make -j4 all  #N.B. the all target must always be built before ctest is run
    ctest -j4 -D Experimental

    (The -j4 option for makes builds the all target in parallel, and the
    -j4 option for ctest runs the tests in parallel.)

    That ctest command (which required ~5 minutes) executed 31 tests that
    are enabled by the above cmake command; created a dashboard of those
    results; and submitted that dashboard to the above project. That
    dashboard (and one previous one I did) can be viewed at
    <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=PLplot_git> and shows the whole
    process was a complete success.  Note that virtually every field in a
    given dashboard is presented on the my.cdash.org cdash server as a
    clickable link that gives more information about all aspects of the
    dashboard in an extremely convenient format.

    Build system: Improve Qt (mostly Qt5) support

    * Change the semantics of PLPLOT_USE_QT5.  By default PLPLOT_USE_QT5
      is OFF.  In this case our build system searches first for Qt4, and
      if no suitable development version of that can be found, then
      searches second for Qt5 (and if no suitable development version of
      that is found, disables our Qt-related code components). The reason
      for favoring Qt4 over Qt5 this way is because at least on Debian
      Jessie, Qt4 has no text alignment or memory management issues while
      Qt5 still does have those issues.  Also, our test times indicate our qt
      devices (which only use a Qt API that is common to both Qt4 and Qt5)
      are a factor of 2 (!) faster with Qt4 compared to Qt5. Because of
      these advantages of Qt4, most users should use this default Qt
      search method, However, note, if a user for some strange reason
      absolutely does not want to look for or use the preferred Qt4
      development support, they should set -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=ON (in which
      case the search for Qt4 is completely bypassed and only Qt5 is
      tried).

    * Update minimum Qt4 version from 4.8.2 to 4.8.6.

    * Improve commentary in qt.cmake.

    * Improve Qt-related variable names so the ones with the "pc_" prefix
      only affect the configuration of our pkg-config files and nothing
      else.

    * Fix configuration of pkg-config files for the Qt5 case.  This bug fix and the
      next bug fix allowed qt_example to be traditionally built
      in the installed examples tree for the Qt5 case.

    * Fix examples/c++/Makefile.examples.in to properly configure the traditional
      build of qt_examples in the Qt5 case.

    * Rename set_qt_target_properties function to
      set_qt4_target_properties to self-document that is to be used only
      for the Qt4 case.

    * This is not necessary for g++ and many other compilers, but for best
      practice Add ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to the included directories
      when AUTOMOC is ON for a target.

    * Work around insoluble visibility issues for the moc-generated code
      in the plplotqt or plplot libraries by using AUTOMOC for both
      the plplot_pyqt4 and plplot_pyqt5 shared objects.

    * Drop unnecessary (from inspections of nm and ldd -r results) AUTOMOC of
      qt.h for qt_example build.  This makes sense since qt.h describes a
      separate library (plplotqt or plplot depending on ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS)
      which already includes moc-generated code for qt.h and qt_example
      links to that separate library.

    * Drop redundant link of the plplot_pyqt4 and plplot_pyqt5 shared
      objects with the plplotqt library when ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS is false
      (since in that case the plplot library provides all the needed
      symbols).

    * Force smokplplotqt build to be Qt4 only because smoke is not
      available (for the forseeable future) for Qt5.

    * Solve visibility issue with smokeplplotqt by running ${SMOKE_GEN_BIN}
      directly on qt.h rather than plplotqt.h.  The latter file only
      #include'd qt.h, but somehow that compromised ${SMOKE_GEN_BIN}'s ability
      to generate code with consistent visibilty.  I only discovered this
      solution by accident, but I will take it!  This change also allows
      plplotqt.h to be removed.

    * Update ndp_UseQt4.cmake to be consistent with the CMake-3.7.0 version
      of UseQt4.cmake.

    This commit completes my planned Qt-related build system work because of
    the unprecedented good Qt5 comprehensive test results below.

    Comprehensive test script: reuse code to roughly halve the logic to be maintained

    Previously, the script had two large chunks of logic which were
    the same as  each other except in the second chunk every instance
    of "noninteractive" was replaced with "interactive", and the ctest part
    of the logic was dropped.  It turned out I could generalize the first
    chunk of logic using TEST_TYPE (which is either "noninteractive" or
    "interactive") so that logic chunk handled both types allowing me to drop
    the second chunk of logic completely.  So this change lifts a
    substantial maintenance burden and considerably shortens the script.
    (What's not to like?  :-) )

    test_automoc project: add ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to include directories

    Note that for these cases ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BUILD_DIR} is not required
    for g++ and many other C++ compilers, but still adding this directory
    to the include directories is still best practice for AUTOMOC just in
    case there is a compiler out there that does not look in the source
    directory for the quoted form of #included headers (this is allowed by
    the lax C/C++ standards in this regard) in the automoc-generated
    source code ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<targetname>_automoc.cpp that
    is specifically added by automoc to the list of source files for the
    target.

    Also, it is not clear that the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property should be
    set directly using set_target_properties because there is a question
    in general (although it doesn't matter in this specific case) whether
    that will destroy INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES inherited from the directory. So
    I took this opportunity to change from setting that property directly
    to using the target_include_directories command which specifically
    appends the specified directories to the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property
    of the target.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by creating a build directory, changing location to that
    empty directory, and then running

    cmake <location of test_automoc project>
    make
    nm --undefined-only --demangle $(ls helloworld_* |grep '\*$' | sed -e 's?\*??') |less
    ldd -r $(ls helloworld_* |grep '\*$' | sed -e 's?\*??') |& less

    The above four commands all had no noticable issues.

    Build system: Fix if argument dereferencing issue that occurs for CMake-3.7.0

    My thanks to Tom Schoonjans for reporting this issue.

    CMake-3.1 and beyond implements policy CMP0054.  The OLD behaviour of
    this policy (which we are forced to adopt because we currently support
    CMake-3.0.2, ugh) is that quoted strings in if arguments are
    dereferenced if there is a variable of the same name that has been
    defined.

    For example in the following if statement

    if(BINDING STREQUAL "c")

    CMake looks for a variable called c that has been defined and uses the
    value of that variable (which is really a nasty bug in the older
    versions of CMake such as 3.0.2 since it is a huge surprise that that
    dereferencing occurs instead of just using the string as is for the
    comparison).  But we are stuck with that bug (because we support 3.0.2
    which implies the OLD behaviour of CMP0054).

    However, modern versions of CMake such as 3.1.x through 3.7.0 do warn
    when this bug shows up. We got no such warning up to 3.6.x, but
    evidentally for CMake-3.7.0, the c variable has been set somewhere in
    the official CMake code (e.g., in the find modules) so for that versin
    we got warnings for the above if statement each time our build system
    code executes the function (pkg_config_file) that contains the above
    statement, and the result was the above if statement failed when
    BINDING derefenced to c, and the pkg-config files that are configured
    by that function were screwed up as a result as noticed by Tom
    Schoonjans.

    I have worked around the problem by replacing the above logic with

    if("X${BINDING}X" STREQUAL "XcX")

    on the assumption that no CMake variable in our own build system logic
    and also the CMake code provided by CMake itself is going to have the name
    XcX, but I have also commented the result with "CMP0054" so it will
    be easy to find and remove this commit once we no longer have to
    support CMake-3.0.2 so that we can use the rational CMP0054 NEW behaviour
    which is that quoted strings such as "c" are not dereferenced in "if"
    statements!

    Meanwhile, we rely on sharp-eyed users like Tom to tell us whenever
    there is a message concerning CMP0054 for any CMake version of 3.1 or
    higher since that is a signal that in virtually every case our CMake
    logic will go wrong (as in this 4.7.0 case) do to this OLD CMP0054
    behaviour.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by comparing pkg-config files we configure in
    pkgcfg/*.pc with equivalent good *.pc results that were derived with a
    previous version of CMake that did not define the "c" variable that
    triggered this bug.  In all cases for CMake-3.7.0, the file names and
    contents of those files are now identical to the good past results.
    Also, because of this fix all CMP0054 warnings now no longer occur
    with cmake-3.7.0.

    Build system: reduce loudness of warnings when a compiler is broken or missing

    Also, for this case advertise (and implement) the
    -DENABLE_compiler_diagnostics=ON option to give full CMake diagnostics
    when a compiler is broken or missing.  This option should be useful
    to users where the broken/missing compiler is a surprise.

    by specifying

    export FFLAGS=-whatever

    and checking the messages that result from

    -DENABLE_compiler_diagnostics=OFF.

    test_linux_ipc: Finish this test project

    I updated both the pshm_write and pshm_read applications to
    the "Unnamed semaphores example" paradigm mentioned in the
    README, and also implemented a pshm_unlink application to deal
    with cleanup of the shared memory if psh_write (which creates
    that memory) must be interrupted for some reason.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin.users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) following the directions in the README.  The result
    was a big efficiency success; a file copy using the combination of
    pshm_write and pshm_read only required 0.3 seconds to complete for
    a 25MB file.

    test_linux_ipc: make pshm_write and pshm_read buildable and implement build system for these two applications

    To make these two applications buildable on their own, I replaced
    their reliance on tlpi headers and error handling with local #includes
    and local error handling (typically a call to fprintf(stderr,...)
    followed by exit).

    Note that although these two applications are now buildable more has
    to be done to make them compatible with the "Unnamed semaphores example"
    that is outlined starting at page 73 of
    <http://man7.org/conf/lca2013/IPC_Overview-LCA-2013-printable.pdf>.
    I have already started that process by adding pshm.h, but more is
    necessary.

    test_linux_ipc: Initial commit

    The point of this project is to familiarize PLplot developers with an
    efficient Linux IPC example as an aid toward reaching the goal of
    figuring out how to make the IPC between the wxwidgets device and the
    wxPLViewer viewing application much more efficient on Linux.
    (Currently there is plenty of room to reach that goal because that
    combination of software is losing up to two orders of magnitude in
    practical speed because of excessive idle times for the current way it
    uses Linux shared memory IPC.)

    Michael Kerrisk's book, "The Linux Programming Interface" includes
    Linux IPC software that is licensed under GPL version 3, (see
    <http://man7.org/tlpi/code/>.) We start this project with three files
    from that distribution (one concerns the licensing text, one is source
    code copied from tlpi-dist/pshm/pshm_write.c that implements an
    application that writes to shared memory, and one is source code
    copied from tlpi-dist/pshm/pshm_read.c that implements an application
    that reads from shared memory.)

    Our further goals are as follows:

    1. Modify these source code files following the shared memory and
    unnamed POSIX semaphores outline example given starting on page 71 of
    Michael Kerrisk's talk (which came after his book) entitled "An
    Introduction to Linux IPC" (see
    <http://man7.org/conf/lca2013/IPC_Overview-LCA-2013-printable.pdf>.

    2. Create a build system for these "pshm_write" and "pshm_read" applications.

    3. Implement a test script to evaluate the communication efficiency of
    these two applications by time comparisons between,
    for example,

    a. cat < input_file >| output_file

    b. cat < input file |cat - >| output_file

    c. pshm_write <input file && pshm_read >| output_file

    where input file is a file that is sufficiently large so that the
    shortest of these examples (which should be "a" for obvious reasons)
    will take roughly one second to complete making all these examples
    easy to time accurately.

    Build system: Move to automoc for both Qt4 and Qt5 cases

    Via the test_automoc project and advice given on the cmake-devel list
    I finally figured out how to make automoc work properly.  Since
    automoc is recommended now and does seem to be a bit smoother than the
    qt4_wrap_cpp or qt5_wrap_cpp macro cases, have moved from those macros
    to automoc for both Qt4 and Qt5 which also allowed a substantial
    cleanup of the build system CMake code for the Qt case and also a
    minor cleanup of the Qt-related C++ code.

    Drop test_qt_example and test_pyqt5_example from general tests for the
    qt5 case because bug <https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/bugs/158/>
    still persists (very likely because of bugs in the Qt5 library memory
    management that have not been corrected yet) even with this new qt5
    support method.

    Note for the Qt5 case, we still do not support pkg-config correctly.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_bmpqt=ON -DPLD_epsqt=OFF -DPLD_extqt=ON -DPLD_jpgqt=ON -DPLD_memqt=ON -DPLD_pdfqt=ON -DPLD_pngqt=ON -DPLD_ppmqt=ON -DPLD_qtwidget=ON -DPLD_svgqt=ON -DPLD_tiffqt=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_qt=ON -DENABLE_cxx=ON -DENABLE_python=ON -DENABLE_pyqt5=ON -DENABLE_pyqt4=ON -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=OFF" --do_test_traditional_install_tree yes

    (Note I dropped the traditional install tree from the Qt5 case for the
    reason stated above.) Neither of these comprehensive tests showed any
    build or run-time issues.

    I also used the -DVALGRIND_ALL_TESTS=ON cmake option so that

    make test_c_pngqt

    tested each of standard examples with -dev pngqt using valgrind.

    For the Qt4 case, there were no memory management errors (although
    there were memory leak issues).  So no segfaults due to a corrupted
    memory heap are possible.  For Qt5, 22 or the 33 examples did have
    memory management issues (typically invalid reads).  I attribute these
    issues to bugs in the Qt5 library memory management that have not been
    corrected yet because Qt4 gives such a clean valgrind result, and our
    qt device driver generally uses Qt5 and Qt5 in exactly the same
    manner.

    test_automoc project: Add the helloworld_automoc_same_include2 target

    This additional target is similar to both the
    helloworld_automoc_same_include and helloworld_automoc_same_include1
    targets. The implementation codes for the three targets are all
    identical and contain both

    (and at the bottom of the file)

    The idea is for all three targets to generate name collisions for the
    generated moc_test_q_object.cpp file in the same build tree
    subdirectory to see whether CMake-3.7.0 diagnoses this issue.  The
    helloworld_automoc_same_include1 target uses the identical source code
    in the same directory as the helloworld_automoc_same_include target,
    while the helloworld_automoc_same_include2 target does the same thing
    for source code that is copied from the directory used by the first
    two targets to a different directory.  I thought that directory
    difference might force cmake-3.7.0 to generate the name collision
    diagnostic that is mentioned in the documentation, but no such
    diagnostic was generated for any of these cases.

    libplplottcltk, Tcl/Tk examples; Fix bugs and move to pure redacted argument lists

    The bugs that were fixed are the following:

    1. A redaction bug in plsurf3dlCmd in tclAPI.c (for the redacted argument case,
    indexxmax was not redacted) was fixed.  examples/tcl/x08.tcl had to be
    changed to use this correct redaction for plsurf3dl.

    2. Bad Boolean logic for the argc checking in tclcmd.tpl was fixed.
    (Without this fix, the number of arguments was effectively never
    wrong, so issuing PLplot commands with the wrong number of arguments
    lead to segfaults and/or matrix errors.) An additional upgrade to
    tclcmd.tpl was to identify the correct redacted call that should be
    used whenever argc checking found an issue.

    The additional changes that were made were the following:

    1. libplplottcltk was changed to support only the redacted API for all
    PLplot commands. (You can go back to supporting both the non-redacted
    and redacted API's by changing the variable if_non_redacted from 0 to
    1 in bindings/tcl/pltclgen.tcl, and by #define'ing
    PLPLOTTCLTK_NON_REDACTED_API in bindings/tcl/tclAPI.c.  But I
    anticipate we will never actually want to do that.)

    2. All Tcl/Tk examples that failed with the new pure redaction version
    of libplplottcltk had their syntax updated to use the redacted API.

    Other than documentation updates for Tcl/Tk, this commit should conclude
    the effort to move to a pure redacted API for Tcl/Tk (unless further
    testing finds bugs or identifies some platform issues).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the "test_noninteractive" and
    test_interactive targets with no obvious build or run-time issues
    and no PostScript differences.

    N.B. similar testing on other platforms is requested.

    plplottcltk library: comment, clean up, and reorganize Tcl code used to generate the interface

    The added comments are by no means complete and were simply added as I
    finally understood the purpose of various bits of the Tcl code.  The
    cleanup was to remove some set commands for variables which are not
    used.  The reorganization was to replace the "round" loop by one call
    (if nredacted == 0) or two or three calls (if nredacted > 0) to a new
    process_args procedure which does most of the work that formerly
    resided in the "round" loop.  This reorganization includes optional
    logic for removing the generation of the non-redacted API for Tcl, but
    that code has not been exercised yet (because if_non_redacted is set
    to 1).

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the plplottcltk library and confirming
    that the three source code files generated by the updated pltclgen.tcl
    (tclgen.c, tclgen.h, and tclgen_s.h in bindings/tcl in the build tree)
    are identical to what was produced by the previous version of
    pltclgen.tcl.

    libtclmatrix: fix bugs in matrix max/min and reimplement matrix initialization and assignment

    The last libtclmatrix commit introduced bugs in the matrix max min
    C logic (such that a default length always lead to an error).  These
    bugs have been fixed in this commit.

    Note that for the previous matrix initialize code, there were severe
    memory management issues if the RHS had more numerical items than fit
    into a column of the LHS matrix, and for other kinds of shape
    mismatches silent failures occurred.  In other words, the only way the
    old code worked was if the size and shape of the lists on the RHS was
    exactly equivalent to the size and shape of the matrix on the LHS.  So
    that precluded, for example using a matrix slice on the RHS (which
    gets interpreted as a shallow list) if the LHS matrix is smaller than
    that RHS shallow list or if the LHS matrix is multi-dimensional.

    Because of these issues, I reimplemented the matrix initialization so
    there are no constraints on the shape or size of the matrix
    initializer list that appears on the RHS of the "=".  As the result of
    this change, the following exotic matrix initialize example works:

    pltcl> matrix a f 2 2 3 = {{{{1} {2}}}} 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
    a
    pltcl> a dump
    1.0 2.0 3.0
    4.0 5.0 6.0

    7.0 8.0 9.0
    10.0 11.0 12.0

    Note a less exotic but more useful example demonstrating
    resizing/reshaping capability is the following:

    pltcl> matrix x f 2 7 = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
    x
    pltcl> x dump
    0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0
    7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0

    pltcl> matrix a f 2 2 3 = [x 0 :]
    a
    pltcl> a dump
    0.0 1.0 2.0
    3.0 4.0 5.0

    6.0 0.0 0.0
    0.0 0.0 0.0

    Note that the array and lists are processed in the natural order (row
    major order as in C for the array or array slice, and in the order of
    the list items that are not lists themselves when the RHS is an
    explicit list rather than a matrix slice.  Furthermore, if too many
    initializers are used on the RHS as in the first example, they are
    quietly ignored; while if too few initializers are used on the RHS as
    in the second example, then the corresponding LHS matrix elements
    are left unchanged from their initial 0 (or 0.) values they are given
    before further array initialization is attempted.

    Note array assignment had substantial issues as well.  (Only one
    number used from the RHS of the "=" to initialize the entire
    specified slice of the matrix on the LHS.) So I reimplemented
    that as well so that all forms of the RHS of the "=" above can
    also be used on the RHS of the "=" of an array slice assignment, e.g.,

    pltcl> matrix x f 2 7 = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
    x
    pltcl> matrix a f 2 2 3
    a
    pltcl> a : : : = [x 1 :]
    pltcl> a dump
    7.0 8.0 9.0
    10.0 11.0 12.0

    13.0 0.0 0.0
    0.0 0.0 0.0

    The new rule for matrix assignment is if the RHS is a pure single
    number that is completely valid according to strtod (for the
    floating-point matrix case) or strtol (for the integer matrix case),
    then all matrix elements on the LHS are updated to that number, but
    otherwise the same routine is called to assign values to the elements
    of the LHS matrix slice as is used for matrix initialization with
    elements outside the LHS slice unaffected.  Furthermore, if too many
    values are specified on the RHS, they are quietly ignored; while if
    too few values are specified on the RHS then the corresponding LHS
    matrix slice elements are left unchanged from their previous values.

    As a test of this new matrix initialization and assignment code, I
    have added some matrix initialization and assignment examples to the
    already existing slice examples in bindings/tcl/test_tclmatrix.tcl.
    This file is used as the source of all tclmatrix examples tested by
    the check_libtclmatrix_capabilities target, and I have adjusted the
    comparison output for that target, bindings/tcl/test_tclmatrix.out, to
    be consistent with these additional test examples.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_interactive, test_noninteractive,
    and check_libtclmatrix_capabilities targets with no obvious build or
    run-time issues. (The test_interactive target originally found the
    matrix max/min bug which has been fixed in this commit.) I also
    sourced bindings/tcl/test_tclmatrix.tcl under bindings/tcl/tclsh when
    run with valgrind, and there were no memory management issues reported
    by valgrind. Finally, I have tried the examples specified above under
    valgrind and obtained the stated results with no memory management
    issues being reported by valgrind.

    libtclmatrix: Add extensive index slice capability

    This implementation was inspired by the Python index slice capability
    and closely follows that model.  I have created the target
    "check_libtclmatrix_capabilities" to extensively test this new
    slice capability by running all the Tcl commands in
    bindings/tcl/test_tclmatrix.tcl under pltcl and comparing those
    output results with the prior version located at
    bindings/tcl/test_tclmatrix.out.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running the "check_libtclmatrix_capabilities" target
    with no issues.

    Build system: filter source tree and build tree -I flags from pkg-config files

    Such -I flags do occur, e.g., for the tk device driver when it is
    embedded in libplplot when -DENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF, but I cannot
    imagine any case where the resulting pkg-config file should be
    generating such -I flags for applications and libraries which link to
    the installed PLplot libraries.  In other words, the install tree is
    supposed to work when the source tree and build tree have been
    completely removed, and the previous -I flags in the pkg-config files
    that referred to source-tree and/or build-tree locations violated this
    philosophy.  Thus, our build system now filters these -I flags out
    of the generated pkg-config files as a matter of principle.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> as part of the
    successful comprehensive testing of the last commit which was limited
    to just the Tcl/Tk components of PLplot.  So the component testing was
    limited, but did include running cmake to configure at least two *.pc
    files without issues, and running and testing the traditional build of
    the installed examples occurred without running into issues so the
    conclusion is there is unlikely to be any typographical error in the
    changes of this commit (which simply added the required filtering
    commands to the CMake function used to configure the *.pc files).
    Therefore, it is very likely this limited component testing is more
    than enough for the reasons mentioned in the first paragraph, but
    later on, as a matter of course, more complete component testing will
    be done, and if any issues are found, this commit is separated from
    other changes so should be easy to find with git bisect.

    Build system: Add non-redacted Tcl/Tk bindings and examples

    In future we plan to drop all support for non-redacted Tcl arguments
    so this commit preserves the status of the Tcl/Tk bindings and
    examples just before commit dbc889263 (the first commit where Arjen
    made changes concerning redaction of Tcl arguments).  Changes to our
    build system (the option USE_NON_REDACTED_TCL_TK) have also been made.
    This option defaults to OFF, but if the user wants to use non_redacted
    Tcl/Tk bindings he only needs to specify -DUSE_NON_REDACTED_TCL_TK=ON
    to get access to the Tcl/Tk bindings and examples just prior to commit
    dbc889263.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by renaming what should be unused Tcl/Tk bindings
    and examples source directories when -DUSE_NON_REDACTED_TCL_TK=ON
    to something else to make sure those directories that should be
    unused really are and the non-redacted directories are used instead
    and then running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ntk=ON -DPLD_tk=ON -DPLD_tkwin=ON -DPLD_xwin=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_tcl=ON -DENABLE_tk=ON -DENABLE_itcl=ON -DENABLE_itk=ON -DUSE_NON_REDACTED_TCL_TK=ON

    The result had no obvious build or run-time errors.  Furthermore, all
    make results from the build tree only referred to the regex
    plplot.git[^ ]*(tcl|tk) appropriately, and all make results from
    the two different build and test systems for the installed examples
    and all the generated *.pc files had no references to "non_redacted"
    (as expected).

    Update FindwxWidgets.cmake to version 3.7.0-rc2

    This version fixes CMake bug #16366 concerning finding unversioned
    VS-built directory prefixes.  See the cmake git commit
    <https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/commit/52e8fa2312c73338c7fac38e7c2b30f136f4d247>
    for further details.

    I also reduced our change to this file to just the following:

    This one-line change is necessary in order for this file to be used by
    PLplot.  This means our licensing text for this file is now identical
    to the official CMake version (thanks to Kitware adopting much simpler
    instructions for complying with their OSI-approved BSD 3-clause
    license) which in turn allowed us to simplify the description of
    licensing terms that we maintain in the Copyright file.

    So aside from licensing details, the effective result of this commit
    is the above bug fix is adopted and the invocation of
    find_package_handle_standard_args has been changed from a home-brew we
    had before to the invocation method used in the official CMake version
    of FindwxWidgets.cmake.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by invoking both cmake-3.0.2 and cmake-3.5.2 to
    configure PLplot.  For both find_package_handle_standard_args cases
    (versions 3.0.2 and 3.5.2), wxWidgets was successfully found using the
    updated invocation of find_package_handle_standard_args.  Further
    testing of this updated wxWidgets find module (especially
    on non-Linux platforms) is requested.

    Build system: Update to the latest Qt5 support method

    This latest Qt5 support method (documented in
    <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-manual.html>) essentially consists of
    appending the targets Qt5::Svg Qt5::Gui Qt5::PrintSupport to the
    Qt5-related target_link_libraries commands. The above URL also
    recommends using automoc and effectively deprecates qt5_wrap_cpp by
    classifying it as an old method.  However, automoc turned out to be a complete dead
    end because it could not handle header files (e.g., include/qt.h) in
    different directores than the library or driver dll source).  Also,
    when I temporarily worked around that issue with symlinks, it turned
    out the automoc results were identical (except for identifying the
    header file as the symlink location rather than actual location) with
    qt5_wrap_cpp results on the appropriate absolute header location.  So
    I stuck with using qt5_wrap_cpp since it worked on the actual location
    of the header file and thus did not require symlinks.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    Note, we specifically do not test the traditional (Makefile +
    pkg-config) install tree since more work needs to be done to configure
    the pkg-config files properly with the appropriate link flags
    determined with this new Qt5 support method. There were no errors in
    the above test which implies this implementation of the new Qt5
    support method is working well (so long as you avoid using pkg-config
    for now).

    pyqt5 binding and example: implement test support for pyqt5

    In particular, implement the test_pyqt5 target.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by installing the python-pyqt5 and pyqt5-dev packages,
    configuring the PLplot build with the -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=ON cmake option,
    and building test_pyqt5.  The result was no obvious build errors and
    the run-time test of examples/python/pyqt5_example.py that is set up
    and run by the test_pyqt5 target worked perfectly.  In sum, pyqt5 is
    looking good with PLplot!

    Qt5 bindings: Bump minimum acceptable Qt5 version from 5.2.0 to 5.3.1

    N.B. Currently, MinGW-w64/MSYS2 packages Qt5 version 5.3.1, Cygwin
    packages Qt5 version 5.5.1, and most Linux distributions package at
    least Qt5 version 5.3.2 (e.g., Debian Jessie packages that version
    despite that distro being fairly conservative about adopting new
    versions of packages). So adopting a minimum acceptable version of
    5.3.1 should satisfy the needs of MinGW-w64/MSYS2, Cygwin, and most
    Linux distros. The obvious exception is likely the so-called
    enterprise-class Linux distros, but we don't go out of our way to
    support such distros since they typically package really old versions
    of every library/software package that often are no longer
    supported by modern PLplot.

    Qt5 bindings: Fix vertical alignment issues

    As of Debian Jessie Qt5.3.2, the vertical alignment issue that was in
    previous versions of Qt5 has been fixed.  Therefore, have removed
    compensating vertical offset in our own code that was required to
    work around that Qt5 bug.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by installing the qtbase5-dev and libqt5svg5-dev
    Debian packages, configuring the PLplot build using the cmake option
    -DPLPLOT_USE_QT5=ON, building qt and _plplotcmodule_fixed (our Python
    interface) and running the alignment test,

    examples/python/test_circle.py -dev qtwidget

    .  The UTF8 "heavy multiplication x", "number sign", "four
    teardrop-spoked asterisk", and "spoked asterisk" glyphs all appeared
    to have perfect alignment. The "large circle + light diagonal cross"
    and "heavy plus" glyphs had slightly bad vertical alignment, and the
    rest of the glyphs tested had bad vertical alignment.  I attribute both the
    perfect and non-perfect results to how well the particular glyph was centred in
    the glyph box for the particular default font being chosen. I also
    checked that standard examples 00 and 02 had good vertical alignment
    with -dev qtwidget.

    I also performed similar checks for -dev pdfqt (which followed the
    alignment for -dev qtwidget as expected) and -dev svgqt (which
    unexpectedly had different vertical AND horizontal alignment than the
    other qt devices which I attribute to alignment bugs in the
    libqt5svg5-dev package for the 5.3.2 version of Qt5).

    In sum, the alignment issues that plagued our qt devices for Qt5 prior
    to 5.3.2 seem to be gone at least for -dev qtwidget and -dev pdfqt,
    and presumably later versions of Qt5 have fixed/will fix the -dev
    svgqt vertical and horizontal alignment issues I discovered.

    Create script to remove trailing blanks from essentially all text files in our source tree

    This script contains the mass 'sed' command that was recently used to
    clean up trailing blank problems in our source tree.  Thus, this
    script should be available for periodic use in the future to remove
    any trailing blanks that have crept into our source tree since the
    recent cleanup.  The sed command includes a regex to exclude certain
    files (binary files, licensing text, etc.) from the cleanup, and that
    regex may need additional review from time to time.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by temporarily adding a blank to the end of line for
    one of our files, and running the script.  As expected, the script
    changed that file to remove the trailing blank, and made no other
    changes to our source tree (since the trailing blank problem has
    recently been cleaned up).

    Fix trailing space issues on most files

    This fix was done piecemeal and sometimes with checks on the
    find results that no binary files were affected rather than excluding
    them from the start (based on the rules in .gitattributes).  But
    effectively the following command was used (and should be used for
    future changes of this type):

    sed -i -e 's?  *$??' $(find . -type f |grep -E -v '\.git|\.pgm|\.gif|\.jpg|\.cgm|\.map|\.dbf|\.prj|\.shp|\.shx|\.fnt|debian/|rpm/|lib/|\.patch|libqhull/src/mem.h|COPYING.LIB' | xargs grep -l '  *$')

    where the exclude pattern is designed to exclude from this change .git
    directory files; all binary files according to the rules in
    .gitattributes; debian, rpm, and lib directory and subdirectory files;
    *.patch files; a particular epa_build file, and the LGPL licensing
    text file from this change.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) using the command

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    to comprehensively test _both_ the noninteractive and interactive
    components of PLplot.  The results showed no obvious configure, build,
    or run-time errors, and PostScript differences only occurred for the
    well-known and long-standing ocaml case.

    N.B. This test is obviously not complete, but it is the most
    comprehensive we have (other than daily use by large numbers of users
    on all platforms) so at least it is a good indication that if some
    error has been introduced by this extremely intrusive commit, it is
    quite subtle and will likely be encountered by few users.

commit 8f31e32db8d8bf36ded30e0a22f5cf09831fa069
Author: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
Date:   Sat Oct 1 13:55:32 2016 -0700

    Build system: Drop unneeded specification files from libplplotada build

    I noticed that the new plplot.ads specification file did not have to
    be included in the compilation of libplplotada so I removed all spec
    files from that compilation so that only body files are compiled. That
    updated compilation procedure is confirmed by my test below and also
    by the rules in
    <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gnat_ugn_unw/Compiling-Programs.html>.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running the test_noninteractive target with no
    Ada configure, build, run, or PostScript difference issues (see
    remarks below about these good PostScript difference results.

    In addition, the backwards compability of the new Ada binding was
    tested by replacing examples/ada by the plplot-5.11.1 equivalent,
    making the following temporary patch (to test those old versions of
    the examples)

    There were no obvious configure, build, or run issues.  There were some
    PostScript difference issues, e.g.,

    adastandard
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19 20 29 33

      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :  20

    N.B. the above PostScript difference issues do not occur when the
    modern Ada example results are compared with the corresponding modern
    C example results (see test_noninteractive results above) so I ascribe
    all of the above PostScript difference issues to PLplot-5.11.1 Ada
    examples that were inconsistent with the C examples in PLplot-5.11.1,
    and further changes in the C examples since PLplot-5.11.1.

    Build system: Update FindwxWidgets.cmake to be consistent with cmake master branch

    The current (v3.6.2-1012-g4171b86) cmake master-branch version of
    FindwxWidgets.cmake is being actively maintained and appears to be the
    same or superior to our own version in all respects.  So I have
    changed our version to be the same as the cmake master-branch version
    except for necessary licensing language changes and the different
    method we use find_package_handle_standard_args which should work for
    whatever cmake version >= 3.0.2 that is being used by the user.

    So the net effect of this commit is users of older cmake versions such
    as 3.0.2 will have access to the latest official cmake version of
    FindwxWidgets.cmake which contains many bug fixes compared to the
    3.0.2 version.  And that desired result should continue if we are
    careful to update our version of this find module to the latest
    official cmake version whenever there is a significant change in that
    version.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by running cmake and building the wxwidgets device.
    Testing on additional platforms is requested.

    Restore backward compatiblity for Ada bindings

    Restore backward compatibility for the "standard" Ada binding that was lost when it was renamed from PLplot to PLplot_Standard, with files plplot.adb and plplot.ads renamed to plplot_standard.ads and plplot_standard.adb.

    A single new file was added, with the old name, plplot.ads. No .adb file is required. Users that have used the PLplot name need not change their code although a "deprecated" note is added herein.

    Build system: make rpath treatment on Mac OS X similar to the rpath treatment on Linux

    This change has been implemented as follows:

    1. USE_RPATH defaults to ON for Mac OS X.

    2. DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH manipulations for Mac OS X have been dropped
    from comprehensive test scripts since those should no longer be
    necessary in order to get the traditional (make + pkg-config) build
    of installed examples to work.

    3. The use of the INSTALL_NAME_DIR property that is specific to Mac OS
    X platforms has changed.  This property normally takes precedence over
    the INSTALL_RPATH property so the build system now specifies either
    the INSTALL_RPATH property (if USE_RPATH is ON) or the
    INSTALL_NAME_DIR property (if USE_RPATH is OFF), but not both.

    These changes mean that downstream Mac OS X software distributors such
    as Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew who install PLplot in a standard
    location will want to use the cmake -DUSE_RPATH=OFF option (following
    the best practice of Linux distributions), but Mac OS X users who
    typically install PLplot in non-standard Mac OS X locations will want
    to use the default setting (USE_RPATH=ON) since that is more
    convenient than, for example, setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH so the
    run-time loader can find where the PLplot libraries are installed in their
    non-standard locations for traditional builds of software that depends
    on the PLplot libraries.

    N.B. According to
    <https://blogs.oracle.com/dipol/entry/dynamic_libraries_rpath_and_mac>
    Mac OS X only supported rpath as of 2007 with Mac OS X v10.5
    "Leopard". So this change means new versions of PLplot will no longer
    work on earlier Mac OS X versions unless the user specifically sets
    -DUSE_RPATH=OFF and uses DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead, but that is a
    necessary condition and may not be sufficient, i.e., it is likely that
    modern PLplot will not work on ancient Mac OS X versions (Mac OS X
    v10.4 "Tiger" and earlier) for many other reasons.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie) by building the test_noninteractive target with
    no obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues and with no
    PostScript difference regressions.

    Tested by: Jerry Bauck <jbauck@users.sourceforge.net> on Mac OS X
    for just the test_fortran project (using a patch that incorporated the
    current set of changes for that project).  The comprehensive test script for
    that project executed without issues.

    N.B. This commit still needs to be tested for the plplot project (as
    opposed to the test_fortran project) on Mac OS X.

    test_ada: remove EOL indicators from comparions of "hello, world"
    phrases

    Arjen's (test_fortran) experience on MinGW-w64/MSYS2 showed the files
    being compared on that platform had EOL differences.  So we had to
    modify test_fortran to drop the EOL indicator "\nl" on the end of the
    "hello, world" phrase, and this commit (implemented with lots of help
    from Jerry) does the same thing for the test_ada case.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian Jessie with gnatmake) by running

    cd cmake/test_ada
    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    with the result that there were perfect comparisons of the "hello,
    world" phrases created without EOL indicators.

    N.B. This test_ada commit keeps that project consistent with the
    recent EOL change for the test_fortran project and prepares for the
    day when Ada language support works properly on Windows.  However,
    that day is still a long way away.

    Made backward compatibility for PLpointer in Ada

    A recent change in the Ada bindings changed PLpointer to PL_Pointer, causing a backward incompatibility. See fdd31ce6. The present change restores that backward compatibility but marks the PLpointer spelling as deprecated.

    Tested by temporarily changing all instances of PL_Pointer to PLpointer in both the traditional and standard versions of Example 14.

    Arjen's test on MinGW-w64/MSYS2 showed the files being compared on
    that platform had EOL differences.  This fix should sort out that
    issue by removing all EOL indicators from the "hello, world" phrase.

    (Debian Jessie with gfortran) by running

    cd cmake/test_fortran
    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    with the result that there were perfect comparisons of the "hello, world" phrases
    created without EOL indicators.

    test_ada project: For Windows case properly support build-tree tests.

    This is done by collecting build-tree dll's in the dll subdirectory of
    the top-level build-tree directory, and it is the user's
    responsibility to put that dll subdirectory on their PATH for the
    build-tree case, but otherwise (install-tree case) ignore that
    subdirectory.  Note, such PATH manipulations have already been set up
    in cmake/test_ada/scripts/comprehensive_test.sh so this fix should
    "just work" when someone tests the test_ada project on Cygwin and/or
    MinGW-w64/MSYS2 without any need for them to do PATH manipulations
    (unless they run tests by hand).

    Untested since this added logic has already been proved to not
    interfere with the test_fortran Linux case, and actual test of
    test_ada on Windows platforms (which will thoroughly test this logic)
    isn't planned any time soon (since it is already known that Ada
    language support does not work correctly for the Windows case and
    debugging that case with test_ada on Cygwin and/or MinGW-w64/MSYS2 is
    going to take a major effort).

    Check the data argument for callbacks that do not use them

    The purpose of checking the data argument for the two Fortran callback routines pltransformf2c and pllabelerf2c is twofold: make sure the binding can be compiled with as little warnings as possible and to make sure that the correct version of the routine is being used.

    The most critical compiler, NAG Fortran, could not be used unfortunately (expired licence), but earlier experiments indicated this change makes the warnings go away.

    Make the Tcl examples use the redacted API as far as possible

    The examples have been adapted to use the readacted API as far as possible. In some cases a smaller part of the vector of data is used, so that there the number of data points is specified explictly.

    This change required a change in some C routines to actually take care of the reduced API. (We currently support a range of argument lists for some of these commands.)

    Adjust Fortran binding to remove unused arguments and variables

    The NAG Fortran compiler produced a number of issues that were related to unused arguments and variables. One set of these messages concerned the argument "defined" for plshade and similar routines. This argument has been removed from the API. While this introduces a limited incompatibility it simplifies the interface, especially as the argument was dummy for all current specific interfaces. The examples have been adjusted to reflect this change.

    Some other unused arguments exist because the routines are callbacks and therefore the API is defined at the C side.

    The various examples turned out to have a small number of similar issues, nothing of any consequence though, but to make them as clean as possible, several changes were made.

    Build system: Fortran binding: Implement WARNING concerning spurious warning messages emitted by the gfortran compiler

    We have achieved good test results for gfortran, ifort, and nagfor
    with this new Fortran binding.  However, one known downside of this
    new binding is it generates some ~50 "marked PRIVATE" warning messages
    when building the plplotf95 target with the gfortran Fortran compiler.
    A typical example of such a warning message is

    Warning: Symbol 'interface_plcont' at (1) is marked PRIVATE but has been given the binding label 'c_plcont'

    It appears these warnings (which do not occur if using the ifort or
    nagfor Fortran compilers) are due to a gfortran bug (see
    <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49111> and
    <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64861>), i.e., they are
    spurious warnings concerning completely valid use of the private
    attribute for interface blocks describing C routines.  There appear to
    be no known negative consequences of this gfortran bug other than the
    spurious warnings themselves.  Until this gfortran bug is fixed, these
    ~50 "marked PRIVATE" warnings should just be ignored for those using
    gfortran.

    This commit copies the above information to our release notes and also
    implements a WARNING message (only if the plplotf95 target is
    configured and the user is using the gfortran compiler) for our build
    system concerning this issue.

    Fortran binding: overall style change for multiply referenced interface blocks describing C routines

    Normally interface blocks describing the C routines that are called by
    the Fortran binding are embedded as part of module procedures, but
    when more than one module procedure uses such interface blocks there
    is a requirement (enforced at least by the nagfor compiler) that those
    interface blocks must be consistent. We have previously complied with
    that requirement by embedding such multiply referenced interface
    blocks as part of module procedures using duplicated code, but that is
    inefficient (in terms of the number of lines of code to be compiled)
    and implies a maintenance issue (to keep that code duplicated whenever
    there are changes on the C side or if we decide to make changes on the
    Fortran side about how we describe the C routine).  To deal with those
    two potential issues this commit replaces all embedded copies of these
    multiply referenced interface blocks by a common and private interface
    block that is placed before the contains line.

    N.B. All instances of such multiple use were determined using
    variants of

    grep -h -A1 '^ *interface$' bindings/f95/* |grep -E 'subroutine|function' |sort -b |less

    where less was replaced by "wc -l" to count instances and the -u
    option for sort was used or not to count total instances versus unique
    instances.  Ultimately the differences between those two numbers was
    reduced to 10 corresponding to 10 duplicates of interface blocks that
    were embedded inside _other_ interface blocks.  (The three interface
    blocks where this occurs are internal descriptions of the fill,
    lookup, and transform callback arguments.) I do not know of any
    Fortran method to use a common interface block to describe these C
    callbacks so I have left them.

    -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    for the gfortran case.  There were no obvious build or run-time errors
    and there were perfect PostScript difference results.

    N.B. this test merely proves these changes have introduced no
    regressions for the Linux gfortran case, and follow-up comprehensive
    testing with Linux nagfor is needed.

    Fortran binding: rework the interface blocks for the c_plsvect C routine

    The nagfor compiler (rightly) requires that a given C routine is
    always described with a consistent interface block, but it apparently
    only applies that consistency test within a given module, and this
    commit goes one step beyond by conforming to that consistency
    requirement across modules for the C routine, c_plsvect (which is used
    by module procedures in the plplot_double, plplot_single, and plplot
    modules).  The plplot module procedure for plsvect has just one
    (optional) argument and maps to calling c_plsvect with first two
    arguments NULL to change to the default arrow style.  That is a very
    different use case than the plplot_double and plplot_single modules
    that requires a different interface block to describe c_plsvect.  To
    correct this inconsistency, I have implemented plsvect_null (with no
    arguments) in src/plvect.c which simply calls c_plsvect with first two
    arguments NULL and last two arguments 0 and then described and used
    that unique plsvect_null wrapper in the plplot module.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) with gfortran by building the test_diff_psc target.
    There were no obvious build or run errors, and the PostScript
    difference results for Fortran were perfect.  In addition, I
    built the svg, x22c, and x22f95 targets and ran

    valgrind examples/c/x22c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg.

    All these valgrind runs produced perfect (no leaks possible and no
    errors) valgrind results, there were no differences between the C
    and Fortran SVG results, and the x22f valgrind run specifically tests
    the normal call to plsvect as well as the variant with no arguments.

    In sum, these are completely satisfactory test results for the
    Linux gfortran case.

    N.B. testing of these changes for the nagfor compiler will eventually
    be needed, but that can be put off until my plans for additional
    interface block and style changes are completed.

    The nagfor compiler (rightly) requires that a given C routine is
    always described with a consistent interface block.  Arjen previously
    implemented this required consistency by removing an internal
    interface block describing the transform callback (for the plfvect
    case), and making other changes which gave consistent but not
    identical code for the various descriptions of the plfvect interface
    block.  In addition, the original implementation of the c_plvect
    interface block did not have an internal interfact block describing
    the transform callback.

    I have replaced those multiple descriptions of plfvect by implementing
    (before the contains) one definition of the interface block for
    plfvect which reinstates the internal interface block describing the
    transform callback that was removed by Arjen's changes.  I have also
    moved the multiple descriptions of the c_plvect callback beyond the
    contains to one description before the contains and for that one
    description implemented an internal interface block describing the
    transform callback.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) with gfortran by building the test_diff_psc target.
    There were no obvious build or run errors, and the PostScript
    difference results for Fortran were perfect.  In addition, I
    built the svg, x22c, and x22f95 targets and ran

    valgrind examples/c/x22c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg.

    The valgrind run on x22f was done 4 times with the following variants
    of examples/f95/x22f.f90:

    tr_callback .false., identity_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .true., identity_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .false., identity_callback .true., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .false., identity_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true.

    where the first one is the committed version of that code and the next
    three are local variants.  As a result of running
    the x22f test with the 4 above variants to x22f.f90, all 6 signatures
    of plvect (namely plvect_impl_0, plvect_impl_1, plvect_impl_2,
    plvect_impl_tr, plvect_impl, and plvect_impl_data) were tested.

    All these valgrind runs produced perfect (no leaks possible and no
    errors) valgrind results, and there were no differences between the C
    and Fortran SVG results for example 15 except in one case where the
    first page of x22f SVG results corresponding to plvect_impl_0 and the
    third variant of the code above differed from the corresponding C
    results (slightly different scaling of the results + completely
    different tick range) as expected.

    In sum, these tests of the 6 possible plvect signatures showed the
    expected results in all cases for the Linux gfortran compiler.

    N.B. testing of these changes for the nagfor compiler will eventually
    be needed, but that can be put off until my plans for additional
    interface block and style changes are completed.

    interface block where it is required in the plshades_impl_0 signature
    for plshades.

    Fortran binding: rework the interface block for the c_plshade C routine and implement a style change for the previous work on the interface block for the c_plimagefr routine

    The nagfor compiler (rightly) requires that a given C routine is always
    described with a consistent interface block.  Arjen previously
    implemented this required consistency by removing an internal
    interface block describing the transform callback, and making other
    changes which gave consistent but not identical code for the various
    descriptions of the c_plshade interface block.

    I have replaced those multiple descriptions by implementing (before
    the contains) one definition of the interface block for c_plshade
    which reinstates the internal interface block describing the transform
    callback that was removed by Arjen's changes.  I have also implemented
    the C routine plshade_null in src/plshade.c which is a wrapper for
    plshade_int that drops the formal transform callback and associated
    data arguments and replaces those with NULL.  I have described that
    new routine with an interface block before the contains, and used that
    interface block where it is required in the plshade_impl_0 signature
    for plshade.

    The new style of replacing multiple consistent but not identical
    definitions of interface blocks corresponding to C routines beyond the
    contains line with one interface block per C routine before the
    contains line automatically satisfies the nagfor compiler requirement
    mentioned above.

    I have also changed to this new style for the previous interface block
    work for overloaded versions of plimagefr, and the following commits
    should gradually work toward the goal of adopting this new style for
    all interface blocks describing C routines.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) with gfortran by building the test_diff_psc target.
    There were no obvious build or run errors, and the PostScript
    difference results for Fortran were perfect.  In addition, I
    built the svg, x15c, x15f95, and x16af targets and ran

    valgrind examples/c/x15c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x16af -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x15f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg.

    The valgrind run on x15f was done 4 times with the following variants
    of examples/f95/x15f.f90:

    tr_callback .false., pltr1_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .true., pltr1_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .false., pltr1_callback .true., mypltr_callback .false.
    tr_callback .false., pltr1_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true.

    where the first one is the committed version of that code and the next
    three are local variants.  As a result of running x16af and running
    the x15f test with the 4 above variants to x15f.f90, all 6 signatures
    of plshade (namely plshade_impl_0, plshade_impl_1, plshade_impl_2,

    Fortran binding and examples: substantially reduce nagfor warnings

    This commit deals with a number of warnings given by the nagfor
    compiler that were reported by Arjen Markus.  From his report the
    only nagfor warnings that should be left are the following:

    None of these nagfor warnings should be addressed for now for the following reasons:

    The DEFINED, DATA, and FILL warnings have not been addressed to reduce
    the number of backwards-incompatible changes to our Fortran API.  We
    already have an uncomfortable amount of such breakage at this time in
    my opinion so we should put off more Fortran API changes until later
    if at all possible, and this decision is an example of that.

    I have left the ERRMSG warning in example 17 because to remove it would
    remove a partially complete programming stanza that we may want to
    finish implementing later on.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie with gfortran) by building the test_diff_psc target with
    no obvious build or run-time warning and perfect PostScript results
    for our Fortran binding and examples.

    N.B. The above test is for the gfortran case and Arjen should repeat
    his nagfor test at his convenience to make sure the only nagfor
    warnings left are the above.

    Fortran binding: rework the interface block for c_plimagefr C routine

    The nagfor compiler (rightly) demands that a given C routine is always
    described with a consistent interface block.  Arjen previously
    implemented this required consistency by removing an internal
    interface block describing the transform callback, and making other
    changes which gave consistent but not identical code for the various
    descriptions of the c_plimagefr interface block.

    I have reimplemented those descriptions with cut-and-paste identical
    code and with the internal interface block describing the transform
    callback reinstated.  For the one (NULL transform callback) case where
    using an internal interface block to describe the transform callback
    does not work, I have implemented in the plimage.c source code for our
    C library a C wrapper called plimagefr_null which does not have the
    callback and associated data arguments and which substitutes NULL for
    those.  At the Fortran level I have described that C function with its
    own unique interface block (which does not violate the nagfor rule
    since it is describing a different C function than c_plimagefr), and I
    call that function as appropriate.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) with gfortran by building the svg, x20c and x20f
    targets and running

    cd examples
    valgrind c/x20c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind f95/x20f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    The valgrind run on x20f was done 4 times with the following variants
    of examples/f95/x20f.f90:

    no_callback .false., tr_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    no_callback .true., tr_callback .false., mypltr_callback .false.
    no_callback .false., tr_callback .true., mypltr_callback .false.
    no_callback .false., tr_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true.

    where the first one is the committed version of that code and the next
    three are local variants.  As a result of these example code changes,
    all 6 signature of plimagefr (namely, plimagefr_impl_1,
    plimagefr_impl_2, plimagefr_impl_null, plimagefr_impl_tr,
    plimagefr_impl, and plimagefr_impl_data) were tested.

    In all cases the valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no leaks
    possible).  Furthermore, the Fortran and C example 20 svg results were
    identical for all variations of Fortran example 20.

    In sum, these tests of the 6 possible plimagefr signatures showed the
    expected results in all cases for the Linux gfortran compiler.

    N.B. testing of these changes for the nagfor compiler is still needed.

    Traditional build system for installed examples: nagfor requires extra level of -Wl indirection

    I have inferred this change is required from an inspection of Linux
    nagfor comprehensive test results from Arjen and also from
    documentation of the semantics for the -Wl option for nagfor (see
    <http://www.nag.co.uk/nagware/np/r61_doc/nagfor.html>) which turn out
    to differ from the semantics of the -Wl option for gfortran (and ifort).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    for the gfortran case.  There were no obvious build or run-time errors
    and there were perfect PostScript difference results.

    N.B. this test merely proves these nagfor changes have introduced no
    regressions for the Linux gfortran case, and follow-up comprehensive
    testing with Linux nagfor is needed.

    Build systems for Fortran examples: fix nagfor build issues for included files

    By default the nagfor compiler does not look in the location of the
    source file for included files (e.g., plf95demos.inc included by
    x21f.f90). Instead, (see
    <http://inside.mines.edu/mio/man/nagfor.html>) included files are
    looked for only in the current working directory (which can be in a
    location other than the source file location).  Therefore, to address
    that issue must specify the source file location (the directory where
    the x21f.f90 file exists) for our CMake-based build system for our
    core build and install, our CMake-based build system for our installed
    , and our GNU make- and pkg-config-based traditional build system for
    our installed examples.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    without any obvious build or run-time issues and with perfect
    PostScript difference results.

    N.B. this test indicates the fix does not interfere with gfortran
    results on Linux.  But the equivalent test as above with the nagfor
    compiler is required to see if this nagfor-related fix works for that
    case.

    Build system: DocBook documentation: CMake logic cleanup

    In 2013 the DOCBOOK_XML_BACKEND=OFF option to configure using the old
    SGML backend tools to build our documentation from DocBook source was
    disabled by forcing DOCBOOK_XML_BACKEND to always be ON which in turn
    forced BUILD_DVI to always be OFF.  Since freezing these options
    appears to have not caused the slightest issue, drop these options
    altogether, preserve all Boolean blocks of code that corresponded to
    DOCBOOK_XML_BACKEND=ON and BUILD_DVI=OFF, and drop all Boolean blocks
    of code that corresponded to DOCBOOK_XML_BACKEND=OFF and BUILD_DVI=ON.
    Also drop the disabled code logic that used pdf2ps to generate
    PostScript results from the PDF result for the
    DOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=ON case since that code was disabled for a
    strong reason (huge crummy result produced very slowly). These changes
    constitute substantial simplifications of our CMake logic to configure
    our DocBook documentation build.

    "For what it is worth" also noted in doc/docbook/README.developers
    what Debian packages needed to be installed to exercise the deprecated
    option -DDOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=OFF which uses a different set of
    backend tools to produce not quite as good PDF results as the
    -DDOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=ON case.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the build_docbook_documentation target
    without any obvious issues for both the -DBUILD_DOC=ON case (with
    default -DDOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=ON) and the deprecated
    -DBUILD_DOC=ON -DDOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=OFF case.  I tested both
    these major configurations of our documentation build because the
    logic changes in this commit are so intrusive, but at some point I
    will probably disable the currently deprecated
    -DDOCBOOK_DBLATEX_BACKEND=OFF option as well.

    DocBook documentation: Improve error messages from XML::DOM::Parser in perl scripts

    The improvement in each perl script was to make the following change:
    -$p = new XML::DOM::Parser;
    +$p = new XML::DOM::Parser(ErrorContext => 2);
     $sects = $p->parse ($api)->getElementsByTagName ("sect1");

    The effect of this change is to add some context to error messages
    generated when parsing the temporary file $api. This newly introduced
    context for error messages makes it much more convenient to discover
    the source of errors in the actual files plplotdoc_info.xml and
    api.xml which are concatanated together (along with some relevant
    entity definitions) to create $api.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by using the cmake -DBUILD_DOC=ON option and by
    building the "man" target.  As a result of the above change, the perl
    script error created by using the "le" entity during local editing
    of api.xml was quickly spotted and addressed by replacing "le" by
    "leq" (one of the entities specifically defined in the perl scripts)
    for my locally updated api.xml.  The plan is to commit that
    locally updated (with "le --> leq" correction for the update) api.xml as
    soon as I am finished making changes to it.

    Changes required to support the NAG Fortran compiler

    The NAG Fortran compiler is much more strict in checking the code against the prevailing standard than most other compilers. Our work to get the Fortran binding and examples accepted by this compiler revealed a number of deivations from the standard were present in the code. They mostly have to do with the finer details of the Fortran/C interfacing.

    Some more work needs to be done for the Windows platform (MinGW-w64/MSYS2) to make it work smoothly, because the support by CMake for this compiler is not yet fully developed and the installation of the NAG Fortran compiler on Windows uses spaces in one of the directory names, which is something our build system does not handle well.

    DocBook documentation: Remove OS notes chapter

    This removed chapter (which gave instructions concerning how to build
    PLplot for various platforms) was completely out of date/misleading
    compared to our wiki which should be the primary source of this
    information. Also, the only internal reference to this chapter was in
    the introduction, and that part of the introduction has now been
    implemented a different way by providing generic build instructions
    with reference to the wiki for the details.

    DocBook documentation:info backend: Do not comment out "part" tags

    This commenting out of "part" tags for the info backend was done long
    ago for unknown reasons, but those tags work fine now for our info
    backend (just like for every other backend) and uncommenting them in
    the info case also allows cross-references to the part tag id's to
    work properly for the info backend rather than generating an error.
    I additionally fixed a file dependency issue for the info target.
    That is, the "info" target now file depends
    on the info-clean.pl perl script used for massaging (e.g., the
    part tag commenting that was just removed) the DocBook source
    code into a form that can be used to generate our info documentation.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linx

    Comprehensive test script: enforce clean start by removing install tree

    This change to remove the install tree before configuring, building,
    and doing build-tree tests of PLplot means all such tests proceed
    independently of any stale install-tree results left from prior runs
    of the script.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    Comprehensive test script: implement DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH manipulation logic for Mac OS X platforms

    When the installed examples are being built and tested, the new logic
    prepends the location of the installed PLplot libraries to
    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in the shared library cases and restores
    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH back to its original value afterwards.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running a local variant of the script with Linux
    platform detected rather than Mac OS X platform as in the committed
    script.  The tests were done both with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH exported and
    not, and in all cases the resulting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH manipulation
    appeared to be done with the correct values at the right times during
    script execution.

    Update parity_bit_check.sh and associated exclude file

    As an extremely incomplete but still interesting check for file
    corruption, the scripts/parity_bit_check.sh script searches for any
    ascii characters that have their eighth bit set for all the files in
    our source tree that are still considered to be pure ascii.  Files to
    be ignored by this script (i.e., binary files or files with non-ascii
    UTF-8 characters) are indicated in scripts/parity_bit_check.exclude using
    regular expressions.

    The updates to the script were to use git rather than svn to do the
    equivalent of svn export using git --checkout-index. The updates to
    the exclude file contain changes to the regular expressions for the
    Ada examples with UTF-8 characters consistent with the recent changes
    to the Ada example naming conventions.  Additional file patterns also
    had to be added to the exclude file to account for the additional
    files with non-ascii UTF-8 characters that are present now compared to
    when this script was last invoked several years ago.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the parity_bit_check executable (using
    make parity_bit_check), putting the absolute location of the utils
    subdirectory of the build tree on the PATH, and running
    scripts/parity_bit_check.sh.  The result was no output, i.e., every
    file checked had no ascii parity bit set. I also double-checked (by
    locally modifying the script to not remove
    /tmp/temporary_source_tree_list and then looking at the contents of
    that file) that git --checkout-index was working properly to export
    the entire working directory of the local plplot git repository. It
    turns out there is a bug in git --checkout-index (see
    <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=823384>) such that
    it quietly does not export the entire source tree if invoked from
    within a subdirectory of the source tree, but I worked around that
    issue by using cd appropriately in the script.

    Build system: Fix bugs introduced by our recent Ada naming convention changes

    The bugs that have been fixed were that "make clean" did not clean all
    files produced by the test_diff_psc target, "make
    clean_ctest_plot_files" did not clean all files produced by ctest, and
    repeated builds of the test_ada_psc or test_diff_psc targets
    incorrectly regenerated results.

    The issue causing all these problems was that the "list_example_files"
    CMake function had not been adjusted for the recent change in the Ada
    naming conventions.  This commit makes that required adjustment, and
    therefore removes all these issues.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target (which produced
    good results), then rebuilding that target (which simply reran the
    usual plplot_test/test_diff.sh scripts without rebuilding anything
    (which is the desired result).  Afterwards, "make clean" cleaned out
    all the PostScript and text files generated by that test in
    examples/test_examples_output_dir.  I also did similar repeat target
    tests and "make clean" tests with the test_asc_psc target with similar
    good results. Finally, I ran "make all" and ctest (which had no
    run-time errors and delivered good PostScript difference results)
    which generated files in ctest_examples_output_dir which were
    subsequently completely removed by "make clean_ctest_plot_files".

    In sum, all issues with the "list_example_files" CMake function that
    were recently introduced by our Ada naming convention changes now seem
    to be fixed.

    grep -i error ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out
    grep -B1 -A3 "Missing examples" ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out |less

    showed these comprehensive test results were good, i.e., no obvious
    build or run-time errors and the PostScript differences were perfect.

    Ada bindings and examples: rename the "PLplot" thick Ada binding to "PLplot_Standard"

    Using PLplot "traditional" and PLplot "standard" to name our two thick
    user-visible Ada bindings has long been documented in our DocBook
    documention for our Ada bindings.  That is a good naming convention
    since the names of these bindings nicely complement each other.  Our
    existing Ada thick "PLplot_Traditional" binding implementation already
    follows this naming convention, and we have now changed to this same
    naming convention for our other thick binding by renaming it from
    "PLplot" to "PLplot_Standard".

    N.B. this is a backwards-incompatible change requiring that all those
    whose Ada code previously referred to the "PLplot" binding in their
    with and use statements must change those references to
    "PLplot_Standard".

    While adjusting our "thick" Ada examples (a naming convention misnomer
    that I plan to correct in the next commit) for this backwards
    incompatibility, I discovered a number of white-space and ordering
    inconsistencies in the with and use statements which I corrected for all
    "thick" examples.  Similar inconsistences in the "thin" Ada examples
    (a naming convention misnomer that I plan to correct in the next
    commit) were also corrected.

    I also adjusted the x00_easy_a.adb for this backwards incompatibility
    even though that example is not curently built by our build system.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target without
    any build, run-time, or PostScript difference issues for the
    Ada "thick" and "thin" examples.

    Change Ada example names on web site buttons

    This trivial commit changes the names on the web site's example pages buttons from Ada(thick) and Ada(thin) which are misleading because both bindings are thick, to Ada(Standard) and Ada(Traditional) to indicate more clearly the reasons for the two bindings—Traditional uses normal, documented subprogram names and Standard uses names that are thought to appeal to Ada programmers. This is in anticipation of changing the Ada example file names/main program names and Ada binding names accordingly.

    Once the example file names are actually changed, lines 185 and 186 of examples.php will have to be changed.

    This change is not tested but should be checked after the next web site build.

    Core PLplot library and C examples: implement and use additional PLplot types

    The motivation for this change is to help simplify our documentation and
    improve our C code understandability/consistency.

    The new PLplot types are typedefed as follows:

    typedef const PLFLT *         PLFLT_VECTOR;
    typedef const PLINT *         PLINT_VECTOR;
    typedef const PLBOOL *        PLBOOL_VECTOR;
    typedef const char *          PLCHAR_VECTOR;
    typedef const PLFLT * const * PLFLT_MATRIX;
    typedef const char * const *  PLCHAR_MATRIX;

    The present set of changes is confined to our C headers, our core C
    library, and our C examples.

    Although these C types could be used directly in our C++ bindings and
    examples and could be used in the implementation of many of our
    language bindings, I will leave it to others to start using them in
    those contexts.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_noninteractive target with
    no build-time or run-time issues detected.

    DocBook documentation: Simplify introductory chapter

    The list of simplifications is as follows:

    1. PLPLOT_WEBSITE (and PLplot-website) now includes "http://" part of
    website address.

    2. Drop "organization of manual" section since that is already
    done well with the table of contents.

    3. Copyright section now simply refers to the COPYING.LIB
    file and the Copyright file which eliminates any ambiguities
    about how PLplot is licensed.

    4. Credits section now simply refers to the part of our website that
    is devoted to that.  This eliminates any ambiguities about who gets
    the credit.

    Adds a paragraph in the "One-offs" section of the Ada documention describing the overloaded procedures for plmapfill and plmapline that were required to allow the Ada programmer to code according to the PLplot documentation which allows passing two types of entities in the plotentries slot, an array of integers or a null pointer. Also mentions the the additional procedures  which do not require conjuring a null pointer.

    Fortran binding: update method of specifying private Fortran floating-point types

    Previously we used kind(1.0) and kind(1.0d0) to determine the
    appropriate kind values used to define private_plflt, private_single,
    and private_double.  However, in the spirit of the previous changes
    for the private Fortran integer types, c_float and c_double are now
    used as appropriate for defining private_plflt, private_single, and
    private_double.  Note the c_float and c_double parameters are kept
    private to the plplot_types module, and I also took this opportunity
    to keep the previously introduced c_int32_t parameter private to that
    module as well.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie with gfortran 4.9.2) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    That script finished without any obvious run-time issues (confirmed by

    grep -i error ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out

    ), and the PostScript differences relative to C results (determined by

    grep -B1 -A3 "Missing examples" ../comprehensive_test_disposeable/*/*/output_tree/*.out |less

    ) were perfect.

    Fortran binding: use C_INT32_T kind for portability (PLINT etc.)

    As Alan Irwin wrote:
    The private types, private_plint, private_plbool, and
    private_plunicode are Fortran types designed to match the C types
    PLINT, PLBOOL, and PLUNICODE as closely as possible within the
    constraint that Fortran does not have an unsigned integer type.

    The most direct way to achieve this in a portable way is probably
    to use the kind C_INT32_T from the ISO_C_BINDING module. This might
    fail if the platform in question doesn't have 32 bits integers, but
    then a lot of other things won't work either.

    Tested by: Arjen Markus (arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net) on
    Cygwin, MinGW64 and bare Windows, all three 64-bits platforms.
    For Cygwin and MinGW64 the comprehensive test script was used, for
    bare Windows the C and Fortran examples were run via a batchfile, then
    the PostScript files were compared.

    C examples: implement C-only if_plfsurf3d Boolean option for x08c.c

    Some time ago when the capabilities of the C version of plfsurf3d were
    generalized to process a variety of representations for the
    two-dimensional z array, it was decided to demonstrate that C-only API
    in x08c.c by replacing plsurf3d calls with more complex plfsurf3d
    calls.  However, that is confusing for those propagating example 8 to
    other languages where plfsurf3d capabilities do not exist and likely
    should not exist since we prefer to handle 2D arrays using the
    preferred 2D representation for each language.  Instead, for those
    other languages plsurf3d should be used with the preferred
    representation of the 2D z array for the language in question.

    Therefore, x08c.c, has been changed to use plsurf3d by default, but
    with the C-only Boolean option if_plfsurf3d to demonstrate the plfsurf3d
    capabilities instead when a C user wants to try those.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target (which uses
    plsurf3d by default for C example 8).  All non-C languages had a perfect
    PostScript comparison with the C results (calculated by default for C example
    8 with plsurf3d) other than the long-standing
    issues with OCaml, namely

    ocaml
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 16 19 33
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    Furthermore I built the svg target and then tried the following tests:

    valgrind examples/c/x08c -dev svg -fam -o test.svg
    valgrind examples/c/x08c -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg -if_plfsurf3d

    The valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no memory leaks are
    possible) for both cases, and the (10 pages of) SVG results were identical
    in both cases as well.

    In sum, these are good test results for this change!

    Fortran binding: update method of specifying private Fortran integer types

    These private types, private_plint, private_plbool, and
    private_plunicode are Fortran types designed to match the C types
    PLINT, PLBOOL, and PLUNICODE as closely as possible within the
    constraint that Fortran does not have an unsigned integer type.

    Previously we used kind = 4 for all these types which by historical
    accident does correspond to 4-byte integers for most Fortran
    compilers. But now at the suggestion of Wadud Miah of the NAG group we
    use selected_int_kind(9) to determine the kind value that corresponds
    to the minimum sized Fortran integers that can represent integers in
    the range from -10^9 to +10^9.  That will be 4-byte Fortran integers
    on all platforms that support those, and, in any case, the C part of
    PLplot will likely not work for the small number of platforms that
    don't support 4-byte integers.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie with gfortran 4.9.2) by running

    libplplot: logic improvements for pl_create_tempfile and pl_create_tempfifo

    Instead of using duplicate code to create the list of directories to
    attempt to use for temporary file and fifo creation,
    implement a static function, get_tmpdir_list, to create the list of
    possible directories.

    The list of directories that is tried is changed to be as follows:

    The directory names in the environment variables:
    "TMP" [Windows only],
    "TEMP" [Windows only],
    "TMPDIR" [Unix only];
    the value of the P_tmpdir macro as defined in <stdio.h> [Unix only];
    the current working directory; and
    the following hard-coded locations as a last resort:
    c:\\windows\\Temp [Windows only], and
    "/tmp" [Unix only].

    The above choices make the following changes in the directory list from
    the previous code.  "TMP" is added for the Windows case; the misspelling
    P_TMPDIR ==> P_tmpdir is corrected and P_tmpdir is now only used for
    the Unix case; and the current working directory is
    added.

    Note get_tmpdir_list delivers a list of non-NULL pointers that point
    to NULL-terminated character strings, and it is up to
    pl_create_tempfile and pl_create_tempfifo to use this list one string
    at a time to find and use the first string that is a suitable
    directory location for creating a temporary file or fifo.  This is a
    substantial improvement on the old code which included NULL pointers
    in the list and which only tried the first list item that corresponded
    to a non-NULL pointer.

    A pldebug call is now made from both pl_create_tempfile and
    pl_create_tempfifo to make it possible to debug cases where
    there are difficulties in generating temporary files or fifos.

    The bugs that were fixed in the previous code were the following:

    * The misspelled P_TMPDIR macro mentioned above.

    * Errors in the open function flags that are part of the solution when
    mkstemp is not available. The O_BINARY, _O_SHORT_LIVED, and
    _O_TEMPORARY flags are now removed for the Unix case since those flags
    are not defined for that case, but those flags continue to be used for
    the Windows case since they are available for that platform.

    * A check for errors was implemented for the mkdtemp call in
    pl_create_tempfifo.  Without such a check the old code segfaulted when
    an attempt was made to create a fifo in an inappropriate directory in
    the list of possibilites.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_c_tk, and svg targets (to
    satisfy necessary dependencies) and then running both

    valgrind examples/c/x00c -dev svg -o test.svg -debug >| debug.out 2>&1

    and

    valgrind examples/c/x00c -dev tk -debug >| debug.out 2>&1

    (The tk case is the only one that currently tests
    pl_create_tempfifo.)
    For the svg case, a perfect valgrind report was obtained (0 errors, no leaks are
    possible) while for the tk case the valgrind report was good (0
    errors, but leaks are possible).  I ascribe that "leaks are possible"
    result to issues with libtcl and libtk.  In both cases the
    appropriate debug messages were obtained as well as the appropriate
    plots.

    I repeated the same two tests for the 3 remaining possible combinations of the
    following two local changes to the code:

    * replace the preprocessing checks of the PL_HAVE_MKSTEMP macro with
    PL_HAVE_MKSTEMP1 to emulate the case where mkstemp is not available.

    * replace some or all of the valid directory possibilities with "whatever" to emulate
    when some or all of the directories on the list are inappropriate.

    The same good valgrind report results were obtained for all these three cases
    which validates how these cases are currently handled by the
    pl_create_tempfile and pl_create_tempfifo code.

    In sum, from all this testing on a Unix platform I am pretty sure this
    code will work on most Unix platforms, but testing is
    required for the Windows case to make sure I haven't introduced
    any showstopping bugs for that case.

    plplottcltk library: Fix bug in plmaptexCmd

    The bug was that GetEntries was used to find the last argument which
    is a scalar integer quantity (unique among all the plmap* variants)
    rather than a vector.  When I replaced that GetEntries call by normal
    processing of a scalar, then the following test

    cd examples/tcl #(in the build tree)
    ../../bindings/tcl/pltcl -dev psc -o testt.psc
    pltcl> source x19.tcl
    pltcl> plinit
    pltcl> x19
    pltcl> plend

    no longer produced the message

    No matrix operator named "62"

    I was also concerned that message was not emitted (before the above
    plmaptexCmd fix) when the following variation of that same test was done:

    ../../bindings/tcl/pltcl -f x19 -dev psc -o testt.psc

    That is, there appears to be a bug in the TCL error message propagation
    in this case.  That message is generated by Tcl_GetMatrixPtr in
    bindings/tcl/tclMatrix.c, and I thought the
    error in the TCL message propagation might be due to improper handling
    of the case where Tcl_GetMatrixPtr returned NULL (indicating an error
    condition).

    To make such errors in error propagation much less likely, I have
    replaced in bindings/tcl/tclAPI.c the ~100 calls to Tcl_GetMatrixPtr
    and their associated hand-crafted error processing of a NULL value
    returned by that function with the CHECK_Tcl_GetMatrixPtr macro
    which I have #defined.  It turns out, the

    No matrix operator named "62"

    message (before the above plmaptexCmd fix) still does not propagate
    properly, but at least this macro approach is a nice code cleanup that
    substantially reduces the number of lines of source code.

    I also took this opportunity to comment out two debug printf
    statements that had inadvertently been left in the previous commit.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target with
    and without the cmake option -DHAVE_SHAPELIB:BOOL=OFF (without that
    option is equivalent to -DHAVE_SHAPELIB:BOOL=ON).  In both cases,
    the PostScript difference result was perfect, i.e.,

    tcl
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    That, is, the above plmaptexCmd fix and the above intrusive macro
    change did not introduce any PostScript difference regressions.

    Solve issues with the redacted form of the Tcl API

    Two examples, x15 and x18, showed differences in the PostScript output. Running
    them interactively revealed small issues in example x15 (not all vectors had
    the same length) and in the plpoly3 API (the vector draw must be one shorter
    than the other vectors).

    With these issues solved we are back to perfect results for these Tcl examples.

    Add allocate statements to prevent problems if allocate-on-assign not supported by default

    Some compilers, notably Intel Fortran, do not support the allocate-on-assign
    feature of the Fortran 2003 standard by default. For Intel Fortran the
    option -assume:lhs_realloc would have to be used.

    To prevent this being necessary explicit allocations have been added.
    The changes were tested on bare Windows with the Intel Fortran compiler.

    Furthermore as the examples were extended to encompass all variants of the
    Fortran binding to routines like plcont and others, the examples were
    tested using the various logical parameters that trigger each variant.
    Two examples will exhibit differences if using the identity transformations,
    but this is inherent to this transformation. All variants give the exact
    same PostScript files and no runtime problems.

    Tested by Arjen Markus (arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net) on bare Windows
    as well as Cygwin and MinGW-w64/MSYS2. All platforms 64-bits.

    DocBook documentation: complete rewrite of the C chapter

    The C chapter of our documentation was completely out of date so had
    to be rewritten.  The new writeup emphasizes C99 standards compliance,
    provides a list (which will eventually be referred to from elsewhere
    in the documentation) of well-documented public PLplot C types
    including the relevant callback types, and concludes with a paragraph
    emphasizing our C examples as prototypes of how to call functions in
    our core C library and the traditional (Makefile + pkg-config) and
    CMake-based build systems for our installed C (and other language)
    examples as prototypes for how to build C applications that use the
    PLplot C library.

    N.B. I suggest that all our different language chapters should be
    changed to include such a paragraph if they don't do that already.

    PLplot core C library: use typedefs to define callbacks

    The introduced callback typedefs are the following:

    typedef void ( *PLMAPFORM_callback )( PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y );
    typedef void ( *PLTRANSFORM_callback )( PLFLT x, PLFLT y, PLFLT *xp, PLFLT *yp, PLPointer data);
    typedef void ( *PLLABEL_FUNC_callback )( PLINT axis, PLFLT value, char *label, PLINT length, PLPointer data);
    typedef PLFLT ( *PLF2EVAL_callback )( PLINT ix, PLINT iy, PLPointer data);
    typedef void ( *PLFILL_callback )( PLINT n, const PLFLT *x, const PLFLT *y );
    typedef PLINT ( *PLDEFINED_callback )( PLFLT x, PLFLT y);

    These new PL*_callback types have names which are largely
    self-documenting.  These callback types considerably simplify the
    specification of callback arguments in function prototypes and
    definitions. I also anticipate they will make it much easier to
    document our callback function arguments in our DocBook documentation,
    although that documentation update has not been done yet.

    N.B. use of these typedefs has so far been confined to our core C
    library and our C++ binding, but they may also be used in the future
    to simplify the implemention of callbacks in our other language
    bindings.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_noninteractive target without
    any configure, build, or run-time errors, and with no PostScript difference

    Fix PostScript difference regressions introduced by dde39c8c (Fix long-standing off-by-one errors in plimage and plimagefr)

    Commit dde39c8c was not sufficiently tested so that PostScript
    difference regressions were only discovered after the commit was made.
    These regressions (discovered by building the test_diff_psc target)
    were that page 5 of example 20 was not rendered consistently with the
    C result for the Python, Tcl, and Java languages.

    These regressions were caused by pltr0 no longer having the identical
    effect as a NULL callback as a result of the off-by-one fixes.  The
    solutions for these regressions are to use a NULL argument rather than
    pltr0 for the C callback when the example has no callback-related
    arguments in the call to plimagefr (this change was made to the Python
    and Tcl bindings), and since the Java bindings do not currently have
    an option to generate a NULL argument for the C callback modify the xg
    and yg arrays in the Java example to exactly mimic the effect of a
    NULL argument for the C callback.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target.  As a result
    of the above fixes the example 20 PostScript difference regressions are
    now gone.  The remaining differences (which have been with us for some
    time) are the following:

    Fortran binding and examples: fix issues with plslabelfunc and plstransform callbacks

    The issues were I had forgotten the "value" attribute in

    type(c_ptr), value, intent(in) :: data

    in several places for the plslabelfunc and plstransform callbacks, and
    I also had failed to transform the label_out data properly for the
    plslabelfunc case.

    In Fortran example 19, I implemented using geolocation_labeler_data
    for the plsfunclabel callback by default (ifno_label_data = .false),
    but if ifno_label_data is locally set to .true. the
    geolocation_labeler callback is used for plsfunclabel instead.

    In Fortran example 22, I made it easier to test the two plstransform
    possibilities: by default (ifno_transform_data = .false.) the
    transform_data callback is used for plstransform, but if
    ifno_transform_data is locally set to .true., then the transform
    callback is used for plstransform instead.

    The issues discussed above were turned up by the systematic testing I
    did below. I thought I had done systematic testing of example 22
    earlier which should have turned up the one value attribute issue for
    plstransform with the transform_data callback but apparently not.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg, x19c, x22c, x19f95, and x22f95
    targets and running the following valgrind commands:

    valgrind examples/c/x19c -dev svg -o testc.svg -fam
    valgrind examples/f95/x19f -dev svg -o testf.svg -fam

    valgrind examples/c/x22c -dev svg -o testc.svg -fam
    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -o testf.svg -fam

    For the example 19 case I ran the Fortran version twice; once
    for ifno_label_data = .true. and once for .false.

    For the example 22  case I ran the Fortran version twice; once
    for ifno_transform_data = .true. and once for .false.

    In all cases the valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no memory
    leaks are possible), and the example 19 C and Fortran SVG results
    agreed exactly, and the same for example 22.

    Fortran example 19: normalize_longitude changed from external procedure to module procedure

    Module procedures (i.e., procedures defined within a contains block)
    are far superior to the external procedures that are a leftover from the
    Fortran 77 era because module procedures have automatically generated interface
    blocks which allows the compiler to do automatic type checking.  Previously I could not
    link the normalize_longitude function as a module procedure so I worked around that
    by implementing it as an external procedure.

    Through experimentation I discovered that the real issue was simply
    (as a leftover from our old f77-like approach) that the type of the
    normalize_longitude function was specified in the calling routine and
    that turns out to be completely inappropriate for module procedures
    that are functions. The current commit removes that type and
    implements normalize_longitude as a module procedure, and the linker
    is happy with that result.  I also reworked the geolocation_labeler
    callback to call the custom_labeler routine which does most of the
    work in preparation for implementing a geolocation_labeler_data
    callback alternative.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg, x19c, and x19f95 targets and

    valgrind examples/c/x19c -dev svg -o testc.svg -fam

    and

    valgrind examples/f95/x19f -dev svg -o testf.svg -fam

    The valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no leaks are possible),
    and the C and Fortran SVG results were identical.

    Update doxygen configuration for creating call and caller graphs

    I did this by setting HAVE_DOT, CALL_GRAPH and CALLER_GRAPH to YES in
    doc/Doxyfile.in.

    I updated that doxygen configuration file using the

    doxygen -u Doxyfile.in

    command.

    I added all Fortran included files (see comments below in the Tested
    by section) and deprecated/old files to the list of excluded files
    in Doxyfile.in.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing with both doxygen and graphviz packages installed)
    with cmake option -DBUILD_DOX_DOC=ON.  My first attempt to build the

    I excluded all such Fortran include files from Doxyfile.in (this

    Fortran examples: test the six possible plvect signatures

    The signatures being tested are (1) no callback-related arguments
    which means the pltr0 (identity transform) C callback is used; (2)
    singly dimensioned xg and yg which means the pltr1 C callback is used;
    (3) doubly dimensioned xg and yg which means the pltr2f C callback is
    used; (4) tr which means a special Fortran callback is used that uses
    the tr array to do the transformation; (5) Fortran callback without
    data is used; and (6) Fortran callback with data is used.

    By default example 22f tests 6, 2, and 3. However, convenient (change
    one or two logical variable parameters) local changes can be made to
    example 22f such that

    tr_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 4
    tr_callback .false., identity_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 1
    tr_callback .false., identity_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 5

    Case 1 transforms the X and Y results quite differently than the rest
    so there are expected differences for this case.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg, x22c and x22f targets and
    running

    valgrind examples/c/x22c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    The valgrind run on x22f was done 4 times (once with default and 3
    times with local modifications of that example to replace 6 by one of
    4, 1, or 5). As a result, the 6 possible signatures of plvect were
    tested.

    In all cases the valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no leaks
    possible).  Furthermore, the Fortran and C example 22 svg results were
    identical for all variations of Fortran example 22 except expected
    small changes in scale and substantial changes in tick mark placement
    and labelling for the 1 case.

    In sum, these tests of the 6 possible plvect signatures showed
    the expected results in all cases.

    xg and yg signature of plvect to calling that signature and also

    Note this change is in preparation for a more extensive change that
    tests all 6 signature possibilities.

    Fortran examples: test all (the now) six possible plimagefr signatures

    N.B. this is an update of commit
    2f25e6f963d205014b747bc566de401f2b103bf1 to test the recently
    implemented "tr" signature of plimagefr (as well as the remaining
    plimagefr signatures).

    The signatures being tested are (1) no callback-related arguments which means no
    callback is used and instead the x and y index ranges are linearly
    transformed to the ranges specified by the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax
    plimagefr arguments; (2) singly dimensioned xg and yg which means the
    pltr1 C callback is used; (3) doubly dimensioned xg and yg which means
    the pltr2f C callback is used; (4) tr which means a special Fortran
    callback is used that uses the tr array to do the transformation; (5) Fortran callback without data is
    used; and (6) Fortran callback with data is used.

    By default example 20f tests 6, 2, and 3.
    However, if local changes are made to example 20f such that

    no_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 1
    no_callback .false., tr_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 4
    no_callback .false., tr_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true. ==> 6 replaced by 5

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg, x20c and x20f targets and
    running

    valgrind examples/c/x20c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x20f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    The valgrind run on x20f was done 4 times (once with default and 3
    times with local modifications of that example to replace 6 by one of

    Fortran binding: implement "tr" signature of plimagefr

    This commit rectifies an oversight in the implementation of the new
    Fortran binding which should for backwards compatibility reasons
    supply a "tr" signature for plimagefr since that signature was also
    supplied by the old Fortran binding.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the plplotf95 library without issues.

    N.B. this is just a build test, and the implementation of a run-time
    test for this plimagefr signature is planned soon.

    Fortran examples: test all five possible plimagefr signatures

    Those signatures are (1) no callback-related arguments which means no
    callback is used and instead the x and y index ranges are linearly
    transformed to the ranges specified by the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax
    plimagefr arguments; (2) singly dimensioned xg and yg which means the
    pltr1 C callback is used; (3) doubly dimensioned xg and yg which means
    the pltr2f C callback is used; (4) Fortran callback without data is
    used; and (5) Fortran callback with data is used.

    By default example 20f tests 5, 2, and 3.
    However, if local changes are made to example 20f such that

    no_callback .true. ==> 5 replaced by 1
    no_callback .false., mypltr_callback .true. ==> 5 replaced by 4

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    running

    valgrind examples/f95/x20f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    The valgrind run on x20f was done 3 times (once with default and 2
    times with local modifications of that example to replace 5 by either
    1 or 4). As a result, the 5 possible signatures of plimagefr were
    tested.

    In all cases the valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no leaks
    possible).  Furthermore, the Fortran and C example 20 svg results were
    identical for all variations of Fortran example 20.

    Fix long-standing off-by-one errors in plimage and plimagefr

    Prior to this fix the selected subset of Chloe image (page 3 of
    example 20) was displayed with a small offset (as determined by blink
    comparing the two) from the original Chloe image (page 2 of the
    example).  This fix cures this offset and also maintains the good
    alignment between the original image and the reduced dynamic range
    variant of this image (page 5 of the example).

    callback is used that uses the tr array to do the transformation; (5)
    Fortran callback without data is used; and (6) Fortran callback with
    data is used.

    By default example 16f tests 6, 2, and 3.

    Fortran examples: Fixed off-by-one error in dimension of single-argument arange

    Bumping this dimension by 1 to the correct value did not make any difference
    to the limited set of examples where arange was called with just one
    argument, but I am still glad this "accident waiting to happen"
    is gone.

    I then tested the single-argument arange much more strongly by
    replacing double-argument arange by single-argument arange whenever
    the starting index was 0.  That caused no errors, see below.

    Fortran examples: test all six plcont signatures

    Those signatures are (1) no callback-related arguments which means the
    pltr0 C "identity transform" callback is used; (2) singly dimensioned
    xg and yg which means the pltr1 C callback is used; (3) doubly
    dimensioned xg and yg which means the pltr2f C callback is used; (4)
    tr which means a special Fortran callback is used that uses the tr
    array to do the transformation; (5) Fortran callback without data is
    used; and (6) Fortran callback with data is used.

    By default the example now tests 2, 3, 5, and 6, but if tr_callback is
    locally set to .true., then 5 and 6 are replaced by 4, and if
    tr_callback is locally set to .false. and identity_callback locally
    set to .true., 5 and 6 are replaced by 1.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg, x09c, and x09f95 targets and
    running

    valgrind examples/c/x09c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg
    valgrind examples/f95/x09f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    The valgrind run on x09f was done three times (two with local
    modifications of the examples to replace (5 and 6) by either 4 or 1. As a
    result, the 6 possible signatures of plcont were tested.

    In all cases the valgrind reports were perfect (0 errors, no leaks
    possible).  Furthermore, the Fortran and C svg results were identical
    when replacing (5 and 6) by 4.  As expected the svg result has
    different tick marks and labels of those tick marks, but not different
    contours when replacing (5 and 6) by 1 since the latter (identity
    transform) case maps to the range of x and y indices, rather than the
    intervals of -1. to 1. that are obtained with either (5 and 6) or 4.

    In sum, these tests of the six possible plcont signatures showed the
    expected results in all cases.

    Fortran binding: implement Fortran callbacks for plcont, plshade, plshades, plimagefr, and plvect

    This implementation was almost trivial because it used the compact
    style, and the required transform callback infrastructure had already
    been set up in that style for the plstransform case.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the plplotf95 target.

    N.B. This build test was a success, but run-time testing of
    all these new Fortran callbacks needs to be done as well.  That
    will require changes to the Fortran examples which are still
    in the planning stage.

    Fortran binding: standardize implementation of plrandd, plslabelfunc, and plstransform

    These 3 functions all have floating-point attributes, but they cannot
    be disambiguated so we only provide the double-precision form of
    these. Accordingly we previously implemented these functions in
    plplot.f90, but we have now moved their implementation to
    plplot_double.f90 because that allows us to use the standard compact
    implementation method.  The advantages of this approach are much less
    name clutter (fewer explicit _double and _single name qualifiers) and
    enabling of a plan to reuse the now-standard transform callbacks when
    implementing full Fortran callbacks for plcont, plshade, plshades,
    plimagefr, and plvect.  The disadvantage of this approach is the
    number of spurious warnings from gfortran, e.g.,

    Warning: Symbol 'pllabelerf2c' at (1) is marked PRIVATE but has been
    given the binding label 'plplot_double_private_pllabelerf2c'

    concerning private C bindings have increased from 2 to 10 (5 each for
    the plplot_double and plplot_single modules).  However, we view those
    warnings as a gfortran bug (see
    <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49111> and
    <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64861>) so hopefully in
    time they will disappear.

    Document backwards incompatibility in plimagefr signature without callback-related arguments

    I implemented this signature for the new Fortran binding some time ago
    to be consistent with how the plshade and plshades signatures without
    callback-related arguments are handled.  But today I realized this
    consistent approach was not compatible with what was implemented (in
    error, I believe) in the old Fortran binding. So I have now documented
    this backwards incompatibility.

    Fortran binding: finish replacing pltr0f callback by pltr0

    The plcont and plvect signatures without callback-related arguments
    (i.e., no trailing xg, yg, tr, or callback arguments) used the pltr0f
    callback internally in the old Fortran binding. However, pltr0f has a
    problematic offset of one in C index interpretation compared to pltr0
    (see further discussion on the plplot-devel mailing list).  Therefore,
    I had previously changed this signature of plcont to use the correct
    pltr0 callback, and this commit completes that change by doing the
    same thing for the relevant signature of plvect.  As a result the
    pltr0f internal callback (called plplot_private_pltr0f) is no longer
    needed by our Fortran binding and has been completely removed.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target.  There were no
    build or run-time issues, and the PostScript difference results for
    f95 were perfect.

    Automatically generate plplotf95_ifort.def from the symbols in the plplotf95 library

    Implement a new (Unix-only) target "check_ifort_definitions_file"
    which automatically generates an ifort def file from the symbols in
    the latest version of the plplotf95 library and compares that result
    with the plplotf95_ifort.def file in the source tree.  If the two
    files are not the same, the user has a chance to review the changes.
    If those changes are acceptable (the usual case), then the user can
    copy by hand the generated file in the build tree on top of the
    existing file in the source tree and commit that result.  If the
    changes are not acceptable (rare), then tweaks must be made to the
    method (a combination of cmake and sed logic) of generating the ifort
    def file from the symbols in the plplotf95 library.

    For the current case, the changes were to insert a commentary header
    (following the ";" comment syntax for .def files documented at
    <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h41zhe21.aspx>) and to
    adjust to a small number of changed symbol names that are the result
    of recent changes (i.e., the plmap* and plmeridians compact style of
    implementation) in the way that plplotf95 is implemented.  So although
    I cannot test this result (no access to MSVC), my feeling is it should
    work so long as the comment syntax that is documented above actually
    works for the ifort case.

    Fortran binding: simplify implementation style for plmap* and plmeridians

    The old style implemented the single-precision and double-precision
    variants of plmap, plmapfill, plmapline, plmapstring, plmaptex, and
    plmeridians explicitly in plplot.f90 with 99 per cent of the code duplicated
    between the two variants.

    For the new style I have found a way to implement these functions in
    included_plplot_real_interfaces.f90 which automatically cuts down on
    the code that has to be maintained for these functions by 50 per cent
    and which makes understanding the interfaces for these functions
    substantially easier.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the x19c, x19f95, and svg targets and
    then running

    valgrind examples/c/x19c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg >& valgrindc.out

    and

    valgrind examples/f95/x19f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg >& valgrindf.out

    These valgrind reports were perfect (i.e, 0 errors, no leaks are
    possible) even for gcc optimization flags -O2 or -O3 (see previous
    commit), the C SVG results looked good, and Fortran SVG results were
    identical to the C results.

    Fix memory management issue for -O2 or -O3 gcc optimization flags

    The issue that was fixed was that for the libplplot core library
    compiled with gcc optimization flag -O2 or -O3, example 19 produced
    valgrind reports indicating memory management issues (invalid reads)
    associated with the allocated filename used in src/plmap.c.

    So I looked carefully at everything to do with filename and did some
    code cleanup (drop attempt to concatanate an empty string, drop
    attempt to save truncatedfilename which is never used, and only
    calculate warning string when that warning is actually going to be
    used).  I also changed the type of filenamelen from int to size_t. I
    have no idea which of these minor changes made the difference, but the
    result is the valgrind report is now perfect (0 errors, no leaks are
    possible) for both gcc options -O2 and -O3.

    Attempt at another fix for the plplotLibDir visibility issue

    The fix for this issue that was just reverted essentially dropped
    visibility for all symbols in libplplottcltk.  The present fix
    instead drops visibility for just the plplotLibDir symbol in
    libplplottcltk.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_pltcl_standard_examples target.

    That custom target built all dependencies correctly which is the
    principal positive test result we have at the present time for the
    present fix.  The custom target also ran the first 14 examples without
    issues, but failed to run the 15th Tcl example because of another
    recently introduced issue (the recent plplat changes for the Tcl
    binding).  Until those other issues are fixed we necessarily must use
    such limited testing of the present fix, but so far so good with the
    present fix.

    Commit b94370e cannot be correct since it stops essentially all
    symbols from being exported from libplplottcltk.  And obviously making
    the library useless like this leads to build errors and/or linking
    issues for all applications that link to it.  For example, pltcl
    requires symbols defined by libplplottcltk to be visible.  I confirmed
    build errors for this application on Linux with gcc option
    -fvisibility=hidden which are solved by the present commit, but
    presumably similar build errors will occur for MSVC prior to

    First step in implemented redacted API for Tcl

    This commit makes it possible to drop most size arguments for the Tcl binding. It does not yet include an adaptation of the examples to this new set-up and testing has been limited so far. Only the generated interfaces have been adapted - for the remaining, more complicated, interfaces not much needs to be done, they already relied on the matrix functions for determining the sizes. The only thing is that some commands are missing one version.

    Solve a problem with the plplotLibDir variable under "bare" Windows

    When using MSVC as the C compiler under Windows, the build for the Tcl binding failed on an unresolved symbol "plplotLibDir". Apparently the combination of macros as used in pldll.h caused this symbol to be marked as "export" instead of "import". With the change in this commit the error disappears and the Tcl examples work fine. This has no consequences for platforms where symbols need not to be decorated with "import" or "export" attributes.

    Tested by Arjen Markus <arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net> on "bare" Windows (MSVC 2013, 64 bits) and Cygwin (gcc 4.9.3)

    Several routines were missing in the .def file - added now

    Due to an error in the Tcl bindings the previous build did not complete, so the examples were not built. A complete build turned up more routines that needed to be exported.

    Correct the names in the .def file for Intel Fortran

    The .def file defines which routines are exported from the Fortran DLL. It appears that this is no longer necessary for gfortran (Cygwin as well as MinGW). Therefore exclude adding the .def under MSYS (shell for MinGW) as well.

    Note:
    The older version of gfortran available under MinGW (the old version), 4.8.3, has trouble with the multiple interfaces to c_plfill and with the use of c_loc for arrays that do not have the bind(c) attribute. Later versions of gfortran do not complain about this, neither does Intel Fortran.

    Fortran binding: convert inconsistent array size case from error to warning

    Our old Fortran binding was completely sloppy about array size
    consistency so our users may well have become completely sloppy about
    this as well.  Our previous array-size consistency enforcement work
    for the new Fortran binding consisted of emitted an error message and
    immediately returning (without attempting to invoke the underlying
    PLplot C API).  There are a large number of such consistency rules so
    Arjen and I have now decided that approach is too harsh and will
    likely encourage users to use the old Fortran binding (or some other
    plotting package, altogether).  So we have converted from that
    harsh approach to a more user-friendly one where we warn the users of
    inconsistent array sizes and attempt to continue with the call to the
    underlying PLplot C API.

    This new more user-friendly approach to enforcement of array size consistency
    has been documented in README.release, bindings/f95/README_array_sizes,
    and doc/docbook/src/fortran95.xml.

    Convert from "==" form to "=" form in shell-script tests

    The "=" form is the form that is typically used in these scripts so
    replace the remaining "==" forms by the "=" forms for the sake of
    consistency and also because the "=" form is more standard usage.

    This change suggested by J. Lewis Muir.

    Minimum CMake version is now 3.0.2 for Linux and 3.3.2 for all other platforms.

    The details of the changes are as follows:

    The minimum version for Linux stays the same at 3.0.2.

    The minimum version for Cygwin has been bumped from 3.0.2 to 3.3.2
    (which should be OK since Cygwin started providing CMake-3.3.2 in
    2015-11).

    The minimum version for all non-Cygwin and non-Linux platforms has
    been reduced from 3.4.3 to the previous 3.3.2 at the request
    of some of the PLplot developers.

    In the future, the rules of thumb I will use to decide when to
    bump these versions is as follows:

    Linux: the CMake minimum version will be bumped when Debian stable
    (currently jessie) provides that version. Debian stable currently
    provides 3.0.2.

    All other platforms: the CMake minimum version will be bumped when
    both Cygwin and MinGW-w64/MSYS2 provide a "matured" version (the last
    in any given minor series of CMake releases which is typically
    released near the time the next series of minor releases is started).
    For CMake 3.x those matured versions are currently 3.0.2, ...,
    3.3.2, and 3.4.3. Both Cygwin (see
    <http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-grep.cgi?grep=cmake&arch=x86_64>)
    and MinGW-w64/MSYS2 (see
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/REPOS/MINGW/x86_64/>)
    currently provide CMake-3.3.2, but not (yet) CMake-3.4.3 which means
    our non-Linux minimum of 3.3.2 currently follows this rule of thumb.

    Fortran binding: implement size consistency checks on array argument dimensions

    I have implemented the same rules for consistency of Fortran array argument
    dimensions as are already established for the swig-generated bindings
    case via the "Ck" arguments in bindings/swig-support/plplotcapi.i and
    also other bindings cases.  I have written an explicit summary of these rules in
    bindings/f95/README_array_sizes and adjusted the Fortran examples to
    conform to these rules.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target with no
    error messages concerning violating the dimension consistency rules in
    bindings/f95/README_array_sizes and perfect PostScript
    differences for the f95 case.  That is there were no Fortran
    regressions due to these intrusive changes.

    Bump CMake minimum version to 3.4.3 for all platforms other than Linux and Cygwin

    For Linux and Cygwin the minimum version remains 3.0.2.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running (using a CMake 3.4.3 version that I built myself
    using the standard bootstrap method)

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    Note the lack of script options which means the script tested
    virtually every interactive and noninteractive component of PLplot in
    the build tree, installed examples tree with CMake-based build system
    and installed examples tree with traditional build system for each of
    our 3 principal linking models (shared libraries/dynamic devices,
    shared libraries/nondynamic devices, and static libraries/nondynamic
    devices).

    The above comprehensive test had no build issues or catastrophic
    run-time issues such as segfaults confirming that all the various
    ways we use CMake to find libraries, configure our build, and
    configure tests all appear to work fine with CMake-3.4.3.

    Update interactive Octave test script

    This script runs a large subset of the Octave "p" examples for
    interactive devices.  This script is called by "./plplot-test.sh
    --interactive_octave" and that command is also called by the
    test_octave_xwin target in the build tree and also the CMake-based
    installed examples tree.

    I updated the script to be exactly consistent with the corresponding
    "p" example part of the noninteractive octave test script except for
    the list of "p" examples that are run (which is generally much more
    complete than for the noninteractive test case).

    I only tested the interactive octave test script for interactive
    devices xwin and tk because the other interactive devices fail due to
    the current well-known stunted interactive capabilities that are
    implemented for the other devices compared to xwin and tk.

    For the Debian jessie version of octave (3.8.2-4) I discovered a
    number of "p" examples that segfaulted (p4, p5, p6, p7, p10, and p11)
    so I removed those and p20 (which exercises p4, etc.) from the
    complete list of "p" examples.  The result was the interactive octave
    tests finally became reliable again with both the xwin and tk devices.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) for the shared case by building the test_octave_xwin in the
    build tree and CMake-based installed examples tree and by running

    ./plplot-test.sh --interactive_octave --device=xwin --verbose

    and

    ./plplot-test.sh --interactive_octave --device=tk --verbose

    in the traditionally built installed examples tree. For what it is
    worth this was done after running "make test_noninteractive" and "make
    test_interactive" from $prefix/share/plplot*/examples, although
    building those targets should not be necessary in order to run the
    above two test commands.

    For all these different tests, there were no run-time errors and the
    interactive results (including the new "Chloe" test image) looked good
    which verifies, for example, that the single location for Chloe.pgm in
    the source tree, build tree, and installed examples tree works for all
    these different tests

    Replace "Lena" image with "Chloe" image

    The "Lena" test image that we used for our standard example 20
    implementations for each of our supported languages (as well as
    special example p17 for the octave case) has problematic licensing.
    For example, see discussion in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna>
    and especially <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lenna.png>.

    This situation has generated a RedHat bug
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1295175> for PLplot, and
    likely other distributions may become concerned with the problematic
    license for this test image as well.

    Accordingly with this commit I have removed all "Lena" content from
    PLplot and replaced it with the test image of "Chloe", a Westie (West
    Highland White Terrier).  I created this test image using the method
    given in examples/README.Chloe.  This derived work has an explicit
    free software license in accordance with the licensing of the original
    image upon which the derived work is based (see Copyright for details
    of that license).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) by building the test_noninteractive and
    test_interactive targets for the shared library case in the build
    tree, and for both CMake-based and traditional (Makefile + pkg_config)
    build systems for the installed examples tree.  (I was careful to do
    all six of these tests because the new Chloe.pgm image has only one
    location while the previous "Lena" images had 3 separate locations.)
    In all cases there were no regressions from previous results, and in
    all cases the "Chloe" test image was generated and displayed faster
    than the previous "Lena" image because of the lower resolution
    (311x240) of Chloe.pgm.

    Clarify copyright language

    As discussed some time ago on list, I dropped the language that
    essentially stated that everything distributed with PLplot could be
    relicensed under the LGPL which is manifestly not true.

    Instead, I have emphasized the vast majority of PLplot files are
    licensensed for distribution under the LGPL, but there are some
    known exceptions to this general rule which are also stated
    in the Copyright file.

    I reviewed the license notices in the files in bindings/octave and
    examples/octave and modified the remarks about Octave file licensing
    accordingly.

    Numerical #defines in plplot.h must be done with numbers rather than C operators

    The reason why C operators such as << are excluded is these #defines
    are propagated to several other files such as
    bindings/swig-support/plplotcapi.i (and indirectly)
    bindings/f95/included_plplot_parameters.f90 and
    bindings/tcl/plplot_parameters.h.

    Make the check_f95_parameters and check_tcl_parameters targets depend
    on the check_plplotcapi_defines target since those first two targets
    generate check results from bindings/swig-support/plplotcapi.i, and
    that file necessarily must be changed by hand if the
    check_plplotcapi_defines target is failing.

    Solve -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issues for Python binding and examples

    The swig-generated Python binding was originally designed to work
    well with both -DPL_DOUBLE=ON and OFF.  This commit restores
    good Python results for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF by fixing the "assumption
    that PLFLT was double" bugs that had crept in since this was last looked
    at.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target.  The
    Python and Tcl PostScript difference summary from that result
    is as follows:

    python
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 09 16 19 27 28 29
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :
    tcl
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 09 16 19 27 28 29
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    I include the Tcl results because they are strikingly similar with the
    Python results, and in fact deeper investigation shows the Python and
    Tcl results are identical with each other (except for a minor rounding
    difference for just one example).  These much stronger differences
    between either Tcl or Python results and the corresponding C results
    are mostly due to lots more rounding errors.  However, for
    example 16, the differences with C results go a lot further than that
    with whole lines in the PostScript file changed.  However, for example
    16 there is nothing visibly different with the gv PostScript viewer.
    So I take the above results as a success for Python (and Tcl) for
    the -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF case.

    But I have two additional conclusions:

    (1) I ascribe the near identicality between Python and Tcl results to
    both interfacing a double-precision example environment with a
    single-precision PLplot library with final PostScript results rounded
    the same way in both cases.

    (2) I ascribe the much larger differences between those results and
    the corresponding C results to the latter being a single-precision
    example environment interfacing with a single-precision PLplot
    library. Thus, the result of that C example difference is there is
    different rounding than in the Python and Tcl example cases.

    Change epochs used for Example 29 to maximize time-representation precision

    Example 29 has been changed for all our supported languages to be much
    more careful of adopted epoch to maximize the time-representation
    precision.  This is a good illustration of how to use epochs correctly
    for our users, and also allows this example to give good results (as
    opposed to errors) for the -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF case.

    I also solved a time-related build issue for our PLplot library
    for the -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF case.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for both the
    -DPL_DOUBLE=ON and OFF cases.

    For -DPL_DOUBLE=ON the PostScript difference report for the only
    languages that were not perfect was as follows:

    ada
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :
    adathick
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :
    ocaml
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 16 19 33
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., there are no changes here compared to recent previous reports and
    therefore no regressions in example 29 results were introduced by these
    intrusive changes to that example.

    For -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF the PostScript difference report was as follows:

    c++
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  20 27 29

    (Note the languages missing from this report are all automatically

    disable because of an overflow in one of the examples that I am still
    tracking down.) The example 29 differences (according to ndiff -abserr
    10) are all small (one unit in the last place) for c++, but there are
    a few larger differences in the f95 and tcl results that lead to a
    barely visible change to pages 5 and 6 (the 1961-08-01 UTC
    discontinuity) for f95 but no visible changes for tcl.  I have
    commented on the remaining -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF example differences above
    before, and I presume nothing has changed for any of those since
    none of those examples have anything to do with the time changes
    in this commit.

    Save pls->difilt in plbuf_bop()

    The various transformation functions can be called before plinit() which
    cause pls->difilt to be set but don't cause pldi_ini() to be called. The
    value of pls->difilt is used in plbop() for the auto scaling of text and
    tick marks so we need to ensure that it is restored before rdbuf_bop()
    calls plbop().

    Fix Tcl binding issues

    A number of code cleanups and logic fixes were done with the
    result that Tcl example 19 now gives good results.

    A substantial number of -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF build issues were also fixed.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for both the
    -DPL_DOUBLE=ON and OFF cases.  There were no regressions against the
    previous lists of non-perfect PostScript comparisions for those
    two cases and Tcl gave perfect results for -DPL_DOUBLE=ON.

    That is the long-standing example 19 issue has been fixed.

    The PostScript comparison summary for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF
    was

    C example 29 is missing
    tcl
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 09 16 19 27 28
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    For all differing graphical output other than 16 the absolute
    numerical PostScript differences as determined by "ndiff -abserr 10
    ..." were small (1 or less).  In contrast to the other examples,
    example 16 had substantial differences (whole lines changed). However,
    I could not see any differences using visual inspection of "gv"
    results, and the above changes have eliminated all obvious "double"
    issues in the C code in bindings/tcl.  Therefore, I have no plans to
    pursue this -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issue further.

    Disable example 29 for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF

    Currently this "time" example errors out (even in the C case) with
    -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF so temporarily work around the issue by simply not
    running this example for noninteractive tests.  Removing the
    workaround will be a few-line change if/when a proper fix emerges for
    example 29 and -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF. The equivalent temporary workarounds
    for interactive tests are possible, but requires substantial changes
    to scripts and then substantial changes again to remove the
    workarounds.  Therefore we deliberately do not implement the temporary
    workarounds in these interactive cases, and instead we will simply
    wait for a proper fix to emerge.

    Disable Ada, D, Java, OCaml, and Octave for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF

    The previous disablement of Lua for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF and the present
    change work around build-time or run-time issues with these bindings
    for the -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF case which I feel are going to take some
    considerable effort to sort out.  For example, the SWIG-generated
    bindings for Java, Lua, and Octave would require similar treatment
    to the current Python binding which is designed to work for
    both -DPL_DOUBLE=ON and OFF.

    Grammatical change:

    According to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding> the
    singular form "binding" is appropriate whenever the binding referred
    to is just for a single language.  Therefore, I also took this
    opportunity to change to the singular form in CMake comments and
    strings in cmake/modules/*.cmake files whenever such change was
    appropriate. This turned out to be a fairly widespread change
    within cmake/modules/*.cmake.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for both the
    -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF and ON cases.  There were no regressions against the

    Fix -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issue: Example 33 (complete previous fix)

    For the -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF case the scaling factor of 1.e-200 that was
    used for plcolorbar results underflowed, and those zeroed results for
    tick marks, etc., caused errors.

    To avoid these underflows I changed the scaling factor from 1.e-200 to
    1.e-20.

    I completed the previous fix by doing the above also for the Python and
    Ada "thick" examples.  (sed script run was not extensive enough before).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for the
    default -DPL_DOUBLE=ON case.  No example 33 discrepancies remain
    other than the long-standing OCaml ones.

    Fix -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issue: replace double by PLFLT in all C and C++ examples

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target with
    -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF.  This test was done just for C, C++, and f95, and a
    local change was made to drop example 29 (which has some
    -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issues of its own) from these tests.  The resulting
    test summary was

    Fix -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF issue: Example 31

    Example 31 was erroring out with test failures for at least C and C++
    for -DPL_DOUBLE=OFF because floating-point constants (which default to
    double for these languages) were being used in argument lists.  I
    solved this by replacing constants with PLFLT variables everywhere
    possible.  Replacing constants with variables is a much cleaner style
    so I propagated that part of the change to all languages regardless
    of whether they were strongly typed or not.

    Fortran examples: replace plflt by pl_test_flt

    We continue to support plflt for those Fortran users who just want to
    follow whatever floating-point precision is used in our C libraries,
    but we also encourage users to use whatever floating-point precision
    is convenient for them since that is now allowed by our new Fortran
    binding.

    We emphasize that pl_test_flt, which is widely used in our examples,
    is a convenience parameter for our developers to help them test for
    precision issues and should not be used by users. To make this crystal
    clear, we have stated this in our release notes, in commentary in each
    Fortran source file in examples/f95, and also in the new documentation
    file dedicated to Fortran precision issues,
    examples/f95/README_precision.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    The PostScript diff summary continued to be clean, i.e., this
    intrusive change did not introduce any regressions in that regard.

    libplplot: Change API of plparseopts, plsetopt, plMergeOpts, plFindName, plGetCursor, and plTranslateCursor

    The return types of all these functions were changed from int to PLINT
    to be consistent with the rest of our functions, and the type
    of the second (argv) argument of plparseopts has been changed from

    const char ** --> char **

    because we recently discovered that plparsopts changes argv.

    These changes were also propagated to our bindings
    and examples.

    N.B. these are backwards-incompatible changes as noted in
    README.release.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    export FFLAGS='-O3 -Wuninitialized -Wunused'

    configuring the build with the cmake option -DBUILD_TEST=ON

    and building the all, test_noninteractive and test_interactive
    targets.  In all cases the build had no relevant warnings
    concerning any of the above functions, and the run-time tests
    that were done as a result of the last two targets all proceeded
    without issues.

    DocBook documentation: More tweaks of the Fortran chapter

    In addition, I took this opportunity to remove all trailing blanks
    in our DocBook files using the command

    sed -i -e 's?  *$??' doc/docbook/src/*

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) by using the -DBUILD_DOC=ON cmake option, building
    the "print" target (which automatically validates all changes), and viewing the results,

    DocBook documentation: remove ancient ChangeLog file

    This Changelog file's last entry was in 2001 and is extraordinarily
    incomplete even for the time epoch it does cover.  For those
    interested in the historical record of the initial stages of the
    implementation of our DocBook-based documentation, the git log
    (converted from cvs to svn to git) is a much better reference.

    Fortran binding and examples: Style code

    I discovered f90ppr
    <ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/fortran90/f90ppr.f90.gz> imposed some
    ugly (to my eyes) style on the resulting Fortran code
    (empty lines replaced by a line containing a single blank, and 7 space
    indentation for many commands at the lowest indentation level).
    Therefore, I have given up on f90ppr, and I decided to use
    emacs instead for styling our Fortran source.

    To do that I followed directions at
    <http://web.mit.edu/Emacs/source/emacs-23.1/lisp/progmodes/f90.el>
    to customize the f90-mode indentation levels.  I set all the indentation-related
    variables to 4 except for f90-continuation-indent which I set to 7.

    I then edited all Fortran source code, and for each file I
    selected the whole file, and then hit C-M-\ to style
    all lines in that selected region.

    For a few cases, the resulting line length was > 132 so I had
    to split those lines via continuation.

    Tests showed this change left some trailing blanks in lines
    so I got rid of those as well with the following sed command:

    sed -i -e 's?  *$??' bindings/f95/* examples/f95/*

    The total of all these style changes are quite intrusive, but the
    resulting style looks good to me.

    N.B. For me the most important styling goal is consistency rather than
    details of whatever style is used (except, I must admit for some of
    the f90ppr style decisions which choked me) so if someone has further
    changes to suggest I am open to those.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target.  The results
    showed no build or run-time issues, and gave a perfect PostScript
    difference report, i.e., no regressions in that result.

    Fortran binding: Final planned improvement for the Fortran version of plGetCursor

    The improvement is to use an appropriate public derived type for the argument
    of the Fortran plGetCursor function and an appropriate private derived type
    for the argument of the interface_plGetCursor function (which is the
    Fortran interface to the C version of plGetCursor), and when copying
    back results from the private to public derived type do all appropriate
    conversions.

    The public derived type is called PLGraphicsIn.  It has no bind(c)
    attribute, and all the types for its components are the normal public types, i.e.,

    * integer,

    * string(len=16) :: string (which is a normal blank suffixed Fortran character
    string), and

    * real(kind=private_double).
    (I had to make a choice between private_double and private_single,
    and I chose the former for best precision.)

    The private derived type is called private_PLGraphicsIn.  It has the
    bind(c) attribute and all the types of its components are interoerable
    ones, i.e.,

    * integer(kind=private_plint),

    * character(len=1), dimension(16) :: string, (where string is a
    NULL-terminated C string), and

    * real(kind=private_plflt)

    These characteristics make private_PLGraphicsIn exactly equivalent
    to the C struct called PLGraphicsIn which is why this type
    of argument is correct for interface_plGetCursor.

    I have also updated the DocBook Fortran chapter to reflect this new
    definition of the Fortran version of PLGraphicsIn and to document the
    constraint that its floating-point arguments are double precision.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian testing) by building a locally modified version of Fortran
    example 01 that puts it in locate mode and verifying there was no
    regression in the interactive results from that mode with both -dev
    xwin and -dev xcairo.  In the latter case, the results were actually
    an improvement because of the proper transformation from the
    NULL-terminated C string component result for private_PLGraphicsIn to
    the Fortran character(len=16) component result for PLGraphicsIn with
    correct trailing blanks rather than the trailing garbage we had before.

    Fortran binding: change plGetCursor into a function

    This commit follows two patches sent to me by Arjen whose net effect
    is to change plGetCursor from just an interface block describing the C
    version of plGetCursor to a full-blown Fortran module procedure that
    calls that interfaced C routine. However, this commit goes one step
    further and changes that module procedure from a subroutine to a
    function and similarly for the interface block since the underlying C
    version of plGetCursor is a function that returns a non-zero value on
    success and a 0 value on failure.

    The use of Fortran module procedure means that Fortran examples 1 and
    20 (as confirmed by nm) now no longer have an undefined symbol
    plGetCursor that can only be supplied by libplplot.  Instead the
    symbol is __plplot_graphics_MOD_plgetcursor_impl which is supplied by
    libplplotf95.  As a result, examples 1 and 20 no longer have special
    linking needs and can be linked just like the rest of the examples
    just to libplplotf95 without it being necessary to explicitly link
    libplot. I have made appropriate changes to the CMake-based and
    traditional build systems to be consistent with that linking model.

    Changing Fortran plGetCursor from a subroutine to a function allows
    Fortran example 01 to work correctly when put in locate mode since
    that correct working requires the detection of whenever the
    return from C plGetCursor and therefore Fortran plGetCursor is equal
    to 0 to exit a locate-mode loop.

    To Do.  We still need to define private and public versions of the
    PLGraphicsIn type argument of plGetCursor.  The private version would
    have real(kind=private_plflt) floating-point components and a
    NULL-terminated C string component, while the public version would
    have real(kind=private_double) (and real(kind=private_single) if there
    are no disambiguation issues) floating-point components and a Fortran
    character array of the correct length that is right-filled with
    blanks.  Then the module procedure would call the interfaced routine
    to fill the private version of PLGraphicsIn, then fill a public
    version of PLGraphicsIn with the appropriately converted values before
    returning that to the calling Fortran procedure.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourcforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    The summary of differences report is as follows:

    f95
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    That is, this commit has introduced no regressions in these perfect
    test results.

    Another test was I ran Fortran example 01 in locate mode (by locally
    changing locate_mode from .false. to .true.).  The results were
    identical to the corresponding -locate mode C version of the example
    for the very first time. That is, clicking with any mouse button or
    hitting any key outside a subwindow or hitting the escape key anywhere
    on the plot permanently exits the locate-mode loop.

    A final test was I ran Fortran example 20 with -dev xwin (the
    only device that currently gives interactive results for
    this example), and I got the same interactive results as
    the C example; the left button allowed me to select an
    area of the image with drag and drop and the right button
    allowed me to escape that selection loop.

    New Fortran binding: plmaptex implementation

    This completes the API necessary for example 19, and, as far as I
    know, this is the last API that we need to implement for this new
    binding.  Furthermore, the test results below are perfect.  Therefore
    after this commit, I plan to land this private topic branch (jointly
    implemented by Arjen and me) onto our master branch.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    That is, that comprehensive PostScript test was perfect.  Finally,

    valgrind examples/f95/x19f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    gave a perfect valgrind report (0 errors, no leaks are possible) and
    gave SVG results identical to the results from the corresponding C

    N.B. plmapfill and plmapline are implemented with separate
    specifically named functions for the single and double case for the
    same reasons as mentioned in the last commits for plmap and
    plmeridians.

    This commit reduces the Fortran missing API to just plmapstring
    (currently untested by any example) and plmaptex (normally tested by example
    19)

    This addition to the Fortran API now allows running the first 4 pages
    of the 19th Fortran example, and the reinstated fifth page as well
    (except for the plmaptex calls which have been commented out for that
    page for this test).

    (Debian jessie) by building the x19f95 target and running it with

    The valgrind report was perfect (0 errors, no leaks are possible), the
    first four pages of results were identical to the results from the
    corresponding C example, and the fifth page was identical to the
    corresponding C result except for the missing text from the commented
    out plmaptex calls.  I also temporarily changed plflt to kind(1.) and
    ran the same tests with the same good results except for a few
    expected minor differences at the +/- 0.03 level between the
    single-precision Fortran example results and double-precision example
    C results.

    of the 19th Fortran example, but the last shapelib-related page
    (currently temporarily removed from the Fortran example source code so
    the first 4 pages can be tested) requires several more plmap* Fortran
    functions to be implemented before it can be tested.

    New Fortran binding: implementation of plmap API

    N.B. this effort is implemented with separate specifically named
    functions for the single and double case that are not located in
    included_plplot_real.f90. As far as I can tell (and I tried pretty
    hard) there is no generic wp-precision way to implement this
    functionality in included_plplot_real.f90 because the C-bound callback
    that is called directly from C (and which wraps the corresponding
    Fortran callback with wp arguments) only has private_plflt arguments
    so cannot be disambiguated.

    the first two pages of results were identical to the results from the
    corresponding C example.  (pages 3 and 4 looked fine, but they did not
    include plmeridians results [not implemented yet] so were different
    from the C results, and page 5 from the Fortran example is currently
    missing).  I also temporarily changed plflt to kind(1.) and ran
    the same tests with the same good results.

    New Fortran binding: intrusive Fortran style changes

    In plplot.f90 that defines the plplot module I added many formal
    interface blocks before the contains that refer to module procedures
    named typically with a trailing _impl that are defined after the
    "contains".  This change was done to match the Fortran style of
    included_plplot_real_interfaces.f90 that is used both for the
    plplot_single and plplot_double modules.

    For both included_plplot_real_interfaces.f90 and plplot.f90 I
    alphabetized both the interface blocks and the routines after
    the "contains" to make procedures much easier to find.

    These changes were obviously quite intrusive.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the plplot_diff_psc target.  There were
    no regressions from the previous (good except for example 19) results.

    New Fortran binding: split Fortran source code

    This splitting is useful because it allows multiprocessors to compile
    the code quicker than before, and also compilers generally have less
    to do if a change is made to just one of these files (which happens in
    typical development so this should be a modest help to developers).

    These source files are now called the following:

    plplot.f90. Contains the plplot module which depends on the rest and
    which also contains all the PLplot Fortran API that is independent
    of the user's chosen real precision.

    plplot_single.f90. Contains the plplot_single module which is required
    for those cases when users choose single precision arguments to
    the PLplot Fortran API.

    plplot_double.f90. Contains the plplot_double module which is required
    for those cases when users choose double precision arguments to
    the PLplot Fortran API.

    plplot_small_modules.f90.  Contains several small modules.  The

    New Fortran binding: C routines that return values are interfaced to Fortran functions

    Strict application of this rule means that plparseopts and plsetopt
    have now both been changed from Fortran subroutines into Fortran
    functions with plGetCursor soon to follow.

    This is a (now) documented backwards-incompatibility with the new
    Fortran binding.  It is documented first because plparseopts is
    so ubiquitous and demands users change all use of

    call plparseopts(...)

    to

    integer :: plplarseopts_rc
    plparseopts_rc = plparseopts(...)

    In addition I dropped the plrandd_single function in the interest of
    complying with the KISS principle of always using double precision
    entities where there is no automatic way (i.e., via the precision of
    arguments supplied by the user) to select the single-precision entity.

    New Fortran binding: interface plparseopts in Fortran

    Because the interfacing of plparseopts in the plplot module requires
    access to subroutine character_array_two_c (the same routine used to
    interface Fortran character string array arguments for pllegend,
    plcolorbar, and plstripc in the plplot_double and plplot_single
    modules), then must move character_array_two_c to its own module
    called plplot_private_utilities which is then use'd from the
    plplot_single, plplot_double and plplot modules.

    Because the interfacing of plparseopts can now be completely done in
    Fortran, the libplplotf95c functionality is no longer used.
    Therefore, remove that library source code and all references to that
    library in the build system.  It was a useful library while it lasted,
    but I am glad to see it gone completely since it makes our Fortran
    binding simpler to understand.

    There was some concern that the c_plparseopts routine changes both
    argc and the contents of the argv array, but I have been careful to
    specify both those arguments as intent(inout) in the interface
    and the results are good (see tests below).

    I temporarily worked around a linking bug in the traditional build
    by making libplplot a public library for builds using libplplotf95.
    But a proper solution of this issue will occur when plGetCursor
    is implemeneted with a module procedure (which means fortran
    examples will no longer have to directly link to libplplot).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    The summary of differences report was as follows:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., we continue to get the same results with no regressions due to
    recent changes.

    Because there was some concern about the intent(inout) attributed for some of
    the plparseopts arguments, I did the following valgrind tests:

    valgrind examples/f95/x00f -dev svg -o testf.svg

    and

    valgrind examples/f95/x00f

    where instead of using command-line arguments in this case, I answered
    the questions that were emitted by the C library instead about device
    and file with "svg" and "testf.svg".  In all cases, perfect (0 errors,
    no leaks are possible) valgrind results were achieved and the SVG file
    results were identical to the corresponding C SVG file results.

    N.B. although this seems pretty good proof that this completely new
    Fortran-only method to interface Fortran plparseopts with C
    c_plparseopts is working correctly, this new method needs testing on
    additional Fortran compilers (especially since Arjen found
    compiler-dependent issues with the old C method of interfacing
    plparseopts that he had to fix).

    New Fortran binding: transform Fortran character string arrays using Fortran language

    Use iso_c_binding module capabilities to implement the
    character_array_to_c subroutine that transforms a Fortran character
    string array into a C array of pointers to C strings.

    Use this routine to process the Fortran character string array
    arguments of the Fortran pllegend, plcolorbar, and plstripc
    subroutines to allow interfacing directly with the C routines
    c_plegend, c_plcolorbar, and c_plstripc.  This means we have been able
    to drop the now unused "fc_" versions of these routines from
    plplotf95c.c and the corresponding plplotf95c library.  Thus, the only
    interfacing left that is done with an "fc_" C routine is
    fc_plparseopts, but I have further plans to do its interfacing in
    Fortran as well, and if I can make that work, that means we can
    eliminate the plplotf95c library altogether.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net" on Linux
    (Debian testing) by building the test_diff_psc target which gave the
    following (expected since example 19 still not implemented) summary
    result.:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    For the svg device I did valgrind tests for examples 4 and 26
    (which exercise pllegend), 16 (which exercises plcolorbar), 17 (which
    exercises plstripc), and 33 (which exercises pllegend and plcolorbar).
    In all cases perfect (0 errors, no leaks are possible) valgrind
    results were obtained, and the svg results derived this way were
    identical to the results from the corresponding C examples.

    I did a valgrind test of example 17 with the xwin device.  In that
    case the interactive visual results looked like the corresponding
    results from the C example for this test, and there were 0 errors
    reported by valgrind in its summary line.  Although valgrind did find
    memory leaks in this case, the LEAK SUMMARY report was identical to
    the corresponding report in the C example so these leaks can be
    ascribed to the xwin device or X library and have nothing to do with
    the new Fortran binding.

    Add .def file for Intel Fortran on Windows and fix plparseopts

    DLLs on Windows require that the symbols that are to be exported are specified
    explicitly. This can be done in at least two ways. Here we use the "definition
    file" approach.

    Using the Intel Fortran and MS Visual C++ compilers revealed a bug in the
    wrapper for plparseopts. If no argument was given, it could free an uninitialised
    pointer. This has been corrected.

    New Fortran binding: reorganize the plplot_precision module

    Rename both template configured precision file and the configured result
    from the confusing combination

    included_plplot_private_types.f90.in ==> included_plplot_interface_private_types.f90

    to

    included_plplot_configured_types.f90(.in) and only include the one
    configured type that we use in that file.  The result is all
    non-configured types are put directly into the plplot_precision module
    rather than included which makes it much easier to interpret that
    module at a single glance.

    I took this opportunity to use default integer types (and a
    private_double type for PL_PI, PL_TWOPI, and PL_NOTSET) in
    included_plplot_parameters.f90 so that users are not exposed (except
    for the 3 private_double cases) to private PLplot types from this
    file.

    New Fortran binding: Make single-precision examples work with double-precision C library

    This test was made by temporarily defining plflt to correspond to
    kind(1.0) while the C library continued to be double-precision.

    One change that was needed was to use plflt real precision as
    consistently as possible to avoid the situation where an individual PLplot
    routine was called with mixed precision arguments. The typical issue that was
    addressed was replacing all dble(...) by real(..., kind=plflt), using
    plflt precision variants of the values of the PL_PI, PL_TWOPI, and
    PL_NOTSET parameters (which are always double), and replacing all
    explicit precision constants (e.g., 1.d0) by the plflt variant.

    Another single-precision issue that was addressed was to change the
    scaling factor in example 33 from 1.e-200 (which underflows at single
    precision) to the maximum of 1.e-200 and an underflow-proof value for
    the particular plflt precison being used.  (This is just a workaround,
    and eventually that scaling factor should be changed to 1.e-20 for all
    language examples to be safe for all real precisions).

    A final single-precision issue was that example 29 just cannot work at
    single precision because of time representation issues at that
    precision.  The solution that I took for this case was to adopt fixed
    double precision for example 29, but a more comprehensive approach is
    needed in general (e.g., drop example 29 for all languages if the core
    library is single precision).

    I took this opportunity to update copyright years for Alan W. Irwin
    and to use a more modern Fortran idiom in the examples such as
    changing all subroutines and functions that are defined in these
    examples to CONTAINed procedures and replacing generic unnamed end
    statements for programs, subroutines and functions with explicitly
    named end statements.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie).  I took advantage of the uniform
    nature of the plflt precision of the examples by temporarily adjusting
    that to kind(1.) while the C library continued to be double precision.
    (So this is the first real test of the new Fortran binding where example
    precision is single and C library is double.)  The issues addressed
    above were mostly discovered with this special test, but after they
    were fixed the examples built and ran without issues and produced
    the following difference report compared to the double-precision
    C example results:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :  04 06 08 09 15 16 18 20 21 22 26 27 28 33
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    I did not look at detailed PostScript diff results, but their
    existence is expected since our examples are notorious for being
    sensitive to precision issues.  I did eyeball those Fortran single-precision
    example/double-precision C library PostScript plots, and they all looked
    fine with no obvious visual anomalies.

    I then following up by restoring plflt to its expected value of
    kind=(1.d0) for this double-precision version of the C library (so both
    example and library have the same (double) precision) and
    built (starting from an empty build tree) the test_diff_psc
    target with no build or run-time issues, and with the following
    PostScript difference report:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    This is (as expected) the same as when I last ran this standard
    version of the test, i.e., the large number of example changes did not
    compromise this good result, but as before there is still work to do
    on the API associated with example 19.

    New Fortran binding: replace "includes" by "imports" inside interface blocks

    This change produced a slight decrease in compile times, and it
    appears to me to be a definite improvement in Fortran style
    to get rid of these large numbers of include statements.

    As a result of this change, there was no more need for the configured
    included_plplot_private_types.f90 file (the file that was included so
    many times previously) so I stopped configuring that file for the
    build.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target in an initially
    empty build tree for the shared library case.  There were no build or
    run-time errors, and the PostScript diff report for Fortran was as
    follows:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    That is, there was no change from previous.

    New Fortran binding: replace "use" statements within interface blocks by the relevant import statements

    Contrary to expectations this change increased build times for the x16f95
    target from 3.2 seconds to 3.5 seconds.  But that may be because the
    gfortran compiler has been optimised for speed to deal with use
    statements but not for import statements, and other compilers
    may build more quickly.  In any case I like this style much
    better so I will stick with it.

    New Fortran binding: add test of locate mode for example 01

    This test only works if the source code is locally modified to set
    locate_mode to ".true.".  The call to plGetCursor will have to be changed
    to a function reference to help break out of the infinite loop waiting
    for events once that subroutine ==> function issue is fixed in the new
    Fortran binding.  See FIXME in the updated source code.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the x01f95 target (with locally
    modified source code to set locate_mode to .true.) and running both

    examples/f95/x01f -dev xwin

    and

    examples/f95/x01f -dev xcairo

    Both gave the expected printed out results you also get for the corresponding C
    example (in -locate mode).  However, they both have some issues
    with escaping the event loop by one of the two usual methods
    which is (1) to hit the escape key or (2) to click on an area
    of the plot that is outside the 4 subwindows.

    The xwin version was put into an infinite event loop because escape
    method (1) is internally transformed to method (2) for this device and
    method (2) only works if the above FIXME is fixed.  The xcairo version
    implements escape methods (1) and (2) independently.  (2) does not
    work for the FIXME reason given, but (1) does work for this device.

    Refine the Fortran equivalent of the PLGraphicsIn data structure

    To make the derived type PLGrahicsIn directly useable from C, I added
    the bind(c) attribute and changed all kinds to C compatible ones (using
    the PLplot kind parameters).

    This way the structure can be filled directly by the C routine and there
    is no need for an intermediate Fortran routine. Since the structure does
    not hold huge amounts of data from a user program, unlike the arrays
    passed for contouring for instance, it is not necessary to have a single
    and a double precision version. In fact, that would complicate matters,
    as the user would have to select either one without getting any benefits.

    Tested by: Arjen Markus M <arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net> on Cygwin
    by running example x20f and printing several fields of the structure.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <irwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the x20f95 target and running it
    using the xwin device.  The resulting interactive selection
    of a portion of Lena's image to plot worked well, just like
    running the C version of that example with the xwin device.

    New Fortran binding: Add logical rectangular argument to plshade and plshades API

    This backwards-incompatible change gives the same flexibility to
    Fortran users in this regard as C users presently enjoy.

    As part of this change we have chosen the correct rectangular argument
    in the Fortran examples following what is done in the C examples,
    and the result fixes the previous differences between example 16
    Fortan and C results and the missing fills for Fortran example 16a
    (for which there is no C counterpart).  My thanks to Arjen for
    figuring out that it was an incorrect rectangular argument that
    was the source of all these issues.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    The summary of differences report was as follows:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., the previous differences for example 16 have now been removed
    by this fix.  I also ran (for the -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95 not mentioned
    case, i.e., the new bindings)

    valgrind examples/f95/x16af -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    and

    valgrind examples/f95/x16f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    which both gave perfect (0 errors, no leaks are possible) valgrind
    reports.  For the latter case, the svg results were identical
    to the corresponding svg results from the C example.  I also verified
    that the PostScript results for example 16a were identical to the
    those same results for the -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON case.

    Implement the -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON option

    I had previously copied a snapshot of bindings/f95 taken at the start
    of the new Fortran binding development to bindings/old_f95, and this
    commit similarly copies a snapshot of examples/f95 taken at the start
    of the new Fortran binding to examples/old_f95.  In addition, some
    modest build-system changes have been made to implement the
    -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON option to consistently use this old binding
    with the old examples to act as an emergency backup in case the new
    Fortran binding does not work for a user and also to extend the life
    of the old version of the Fortran binding to be used for old
    programmes that are no longer being developed in the slightest.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running both

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    and

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    with the expected results in both cases

    -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95 not mentioned (which is equivalent to
    -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=OFF, i.e., the new Fortran examples and new
    Fortran binding):

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :  16
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    Example 19 is missing from both comparisons because that example does
    not yet work in the latter case and I could not be bothered to
    configure different lists of examples for -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=ON and
    -DPL_DEPRECATED_f95=OFF.  For the new bindings and examples Fortran
    example 16 has different graphical results than the corresponding C
    example because I have implemented the fix for the rectangular issue
    that Arjen discovered, but I have stashed that work for this
    comparison so that stashed result could be committed and tested
    separately after the present commit.

    New Fortran binding: add plslabelfunc API with full callback

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the library and an uncommitted version of
    example 19 with all the currently unimplemented API dropped.

    The build was clean and

    gave a perfect result and also good-looking custom labels.

    New Fortran binding: Add full data argument capability to plstransform and corresponding callback

    I used the method given in "V: Using type(c_ptr) Pointer" of
    <http://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html> to allow the user
    to pass an arbitrary user-defined definition as an argument of a
    callback.  This additional signature for plstransform that allows this
    is distinguished by an additional data argument and a Fortran callback
    that has an additional data argument as well.  Furthermore, we have
    done all the plumbing in plplot_bindings.f90 such that this callback
    is interfaced properly with c_plstransform.

    This method has been used in example 22 to pass what before was a
    value stored in a common block as the data argument of the newly
    defined transform_data Fortran callback that is used by plstransfrom
    with a properly defined data argument in the example.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg and x22f95 targets and running

    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    with a perfect valgrind report and svg results that were identical
    to the corresponding C results.

    New Fortran binding: fix Linux build issues with previous commit

    Those build issues were the following:

    * pltr0f does not exist at the C level and must be replaced with
    pltr0.  Furthermore the interface for it needs a different data type
    for the unused (NULL) data argument, and a consistent name (now pltr0)
    must be used for both the subroutine and end subroutine statements.

    * The first argument to the call to interface_plfcont is changed
    to plf2evalr while the transform argument is changed to pltr0.

    * module procedure plstransform_double must be modified
    to drop the data argument and plstransform_single must
    be removed (otherwise, if it were changed the same
    way there would a disambiguation issue).

    N.B. the first two changes above do allow contour_0 to build, but
    example 9 changes are still required to actually test this variant of
    plcont at run time.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    with no obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues for our
    standard 3 principal configurations.  The test summary continues to be

    f95
    Missing examples            :  19
    Differing graphical output  :  16
    Missing stdout              :

    I also ran

    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    to test the plstransform change, and that gave a perfect (0 errors, no
    leaks are possible) valgrind report and svg graphical results that
    agreed exactly with the corresponding svg results from C.

    Correct the interface routine plcontour_0 and implement a robust callback for transformations

    The routine plfcont requires a transformation routine, this was missing from
    the simplest version, plcontour_0. The current implementation uses the identity
    mapping pltr0f.

    A second small but essential change is the way the transformation callback
    routines are handled. Because the Fortran standard does not allow
    disambiguation via the argument list of procedure arguments, we decided to
    use a different approach: the callback routine should always use double
    precision, independent of the precision of the rest of the program

    Tested by Arjen Markus <arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net> on Cygwin, using gfortran.

    New Fortran binding: convert 22nd example to use modern Fortran idioms

    As a result of this fairly minor change to this example (mostly to the
    "transform" callback function) we now have a method for enforcing the
    correct number and type of arguments for callback routines.  I assume
    the essential here is that the transform callback now appears after
    a "contains" statement which if I recall correctly automatically generates
    an interface corresponding to transform, and because that interface
    disagrees with the library one it generates a build-time error.  That,
    of course is a vast improvement over the previous situation where the
    only error for wrong number or type of arguments in the callback was
    a segfault at run time.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the svg and x22f95 targets and then running

    valgrind examples/f95/x22f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    This produced a perfect valgrind report (0 errors, no leaks are
    possible) and also svg results that were identical to the
    corresponding C example results.

    I also made tests of the type safety of the callback by changing the
    number and kind of arguments to transform.  In all these cases the gfortran
    compiler emitted the following error message:

    Error: There is no specific subroutine for the generic 'plstransform'

    Strangely enough, despite gfortran being able to recognize when the
    interface to the callback supplied by the user has the wrong number or
    type of arguments, it still complains when attempting to build the
    library that it cannot disambiguate plstransform if the disambiguation
    parameter is consistently removed from the Fortran library
    implemention of plstransform and also the use of plstransform in this
    example.

    New Fortran binding: Add dimension checking, improve 2D transformation code consistency, and fix plimagefr bugs

    The dimension checking additions (mostly for xg, and yg) were for
    plshade_single_1, plshade_single_2, plshades_multiple_1,
    plshades_multiple_2, plvectors_1, and plvectors_2.  This means we
    should now have consistent dimension checking of xg and yg
    for all variants of plcont, plshade, plshades, plvect, and plimagefr.

    The transformation consistency improvements were to use identical code
    for pltr2f for all cases where xg and yg were two-dimensional in the
    new Fortran binding.  And to use identical code for transform for all
    related signatures: _0, _1, _2, and _tr (referring to plcont, plshade,
    plshades, plvect, and plimagefr signatures where xg, yg, and tr are
    not in the argument list, 1D xg and yg are in the argument list but
    not tr, 2D xg and yg are in the argument list but not tr, and xg, and
    yg are not in the argument list, but tr is in the argument list.)

    The plimagefr bug fix is I forgot to use xg_in and yg_in for the _1
    and _2 cases.  This bug would generate run-time issues for the case
    when kind=kp is different than private_plflt. But we don't test that
    case now which explains why the plimagefr tests looked good before
    this fix.

    I also made sure all "use" statements had an associated "only" clause,
    and I often checked that clause to make sure the minimum necessary was
    being used from each module.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for
    the shared library case.  The fortran summary result remained the
    same

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :  16
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., Fortran example 16 is still not consistent with the
    corresponding C result.  And further looks at diff files between the
    Fortran and C results for the svg case and visual inspection of
    example 16a showed all issues were for 2D xg and yg and were generally
    due to missing fills for the Fortran case.  And valgrind
    results for Fortran examples 16 and 16a continue to be perfect.

    So the above changes made absolutely no difference to the missing
    fills issue for plshade and plshades with "_2" signature, but they
    have cleared out a lot of obfuscating differences in code between the
    various "_2" signatures for 2D xg and yg, and they now also do much
    better checking of the dimensions of xg and yg in all cases.

    New Fortran binding: Add remaining API relevant to examples 16 (and
    16a), 21, and 22

    That is, I implemented the full plshade. plshades and plvect families
    of routines as well as plstransform. For now, the latter required an
    added dummy "data" argument to disambiguate the single- and
    double-precision versions, but since that is a backwards-incompatible
    change to the Fortran API, Alan will attempt to find another solution.

    Furthermore, because the routines for the plstransform callback are used
    by C they must be externally visible and have a unique name. Therefore
    I put them in the file plplot_bindings instead of in the included file.

    Tested by: Arjen Markus <arjen.markus@deltares.nl> on Cygwin with
    gfortran as well as compiled using Intel Fortran under Windows. One
    thing that remains to be done is plGetCursor.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target for the
    shared library case.  The result summary was

    f95
      Missing examples            :  19
      Differing graphical output  :  16
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., examples 16, 21, and 22 have now been added to the list of
    Fortran examples which are buildable.

    Examples 21 and 22 produce the same -dev psc results as the
    corresponding C examples, but there are substantial differences for
    example 16.  Further investigation showed the 16th Fortran example had
    substantially fewer fills then the corresponding C example but those
    extra C fills may have been cropped or behind other fills because the
    C and Fortran results were visually indistinguishable. To simplify the
    investigatio I tried nx, ny = 3, 4 for both the C and Fortran example,
    but in that case there were identical results.  So the investigation
    of this issue continues.

    Example 16a was also added to the list of buildable examples, and the
    resulting first page of the plot looks good (although it has been
    years since I looked at it so I cannot guarantee there has been no
    change).  The second page of the plot has some bad-looking vacant
    areas, however, so clearly there is some issue with the plshade
    variant that was used to produce that result.

    The valgrind reports for

    valgrind examples/f95/x<example id>f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    where example id is (unmodified or modified) 16, 16a, 21, and 22 are all perfect (0 errors, no
    leaks are possible).

    New Fortran binding: Add remaining API relevant to example 20

    That is, add plimagefr (with 3 variants for no xg, yg,
    single-dimensioned xg, yg, and double-dimensioned xg, yg). This is
    sufficient for example 20, but still have to also add _tr variant to
    give fortran users an additional standard way to map transforms
    for plimagefr.

    I fixed an uninitialized bug in examples/f95/x20.f90 that was
    discovered by valgrind by initializing the character array that is
    written to a temporary file to help determine the logical record
    length of Fortran direct access files for any given Fortran platform.

    I also took this opportunity to tighten up the plcont only: and size
    consistency checking logic.  I also noticed a bug, (but did not fix
    it) for the contour_0 case which will likely currently segfault
    (missing value attribute), but when that is fixed, it will just end
    with an error message since c_plcont specifically does not allow a
    NULL pltr callback.  Instead, contour_0 needs to be changed to use the
    pltr0 identity transform.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    t_interactive no

    with no obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues for our
    standard 3 principal configurations.  The test summary is

    f95
      Missing examples            :  16 19 21 22
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., example 20 has now been added to the list of Fortran examples which
    are buildable and which have the same -dev psc results as the corresponding C
    examples.

    For example 20 I got perfect results (0 errors, no leaks are possible)
    for

    valgrind examples/f95/x20f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    Those svg graphical results agreed exactly with the corresponding svg
    results from C.  (Note that the svg device has full PLplot
    capabilities so this is a more powerful test than the -dev psc tests
    that are done with the above comprehensive test.)

    I did some additional valgrind testing of some variants (now
    dropped with and "if(.false.) then [....] endif) that used both the
    doubly dimensioned and singly dimensioned xg, yg variants to plot an
    untransformed "Lena". The valgrind report was perfect for these
    variants, and they produced identical results with each other and
    results that were visually identical to the plimage results for
    "Lena".  But the filling method is different in the plimage versus
    plimagefr cases (the pixel to the lower right of the given point is
    filled in the plimagefr case) so the numerical results are different.

    Because I had made substantial editing changes for the plcont cases, I
    ran

    valgrind examples/f95/x09f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    New Fortran binding: Adopt a strict rule that Fortran logical corresponds to C PLBOOL type

    This is a backwards-incompatible change which is documented in
    README.release.

    The plarc module procedure now strictly conforms to the above rule
    with the extra signature with integer fill type dropped.

    The plconfigtime ifbtime_offset argument has now been changed to
    logical in conformity with the above rule.

    I have now defined and used the private_plbool = 4 parameter to help
    indicate in module procedure interfaces (by using private_plbool as a
    kind value) when the corresponding C routine has an argument with
    PLBOOL type.

    I also took this opportunity to fix some substantial errors (no value
    assigned, and comparison with wrong kind parameter of private_plflt
    rather than private_plint) in logic concerning npts_local for all
    three plsvect module_procedures (plsvect_double, plsvect_none, and
    plsvect_single). Note, that plsvect still is not being run-tested by
    the tests below since example 22, the only example that exercises
    plsvect, does not currently build.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_tes
    t_interactive no

    with no obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues for our
    standard 3 principal configurations.  The test summary continues to be

    f95
      Missing examples            :  16 19 20 21 22
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    We cannot currently build or run those "missing" examples because of
    the following remaining issues with the new Fortran binding:

    16, plshades not implemented yet;
    19, plmap*, plmeridians, plslabelfunc, and  plstransform not implemented yet;
    20, plimagefr not implemented yet;
    21, plshades not implemented yet; and
    22, plshades, plstransform, and plvect not implemented yet.

    And because these examples cannot currently be run-time tested yet
    additional API that is referenced in them but in no other examples (such as
    plsvect mentioned above) continues not to be run-time tested.

    New Fortran binding: add API for plsdrawmode, plsmem, plsmema, and plstart

    None of these are tested by the Fortran examples, but they complete
    implementation of all common API (those with "c_" prefixes) for
    Fortran other than deprecated routines (which we do not want to
    propagate to new Fortran in any case), and the following list of
    routines which have callbacks in their argument lists:

    c_plimagefr
    c_plmap
    c_plmapfill
    c_plmapline
    c_plmapstring
    c_plmaptex
    c_plmeridians
    c_plshades
    c_plslabelfunc
    c_plstransform
    c_plvect

    The above missing list of routines means we are currently unable to build
    or test Fortran examples 16 19 20 21 22, but it should not take that
    long to implement the remaining API above and build and test this list
    of examples.

    Note, I also took this opportunity to reorder the routines in
    bindings/f95/included_plplot_real_interfaces.f90 and
    bindings/f95/plplot_bindings.f90 in alphabetical order which makes
    this commit somewhat intrusive.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the plplotf95 target without build errors
    and checking the resulting library with "ldd -r".

    (No run-time tests of plsdrawmode, plsmem, plsmema, and plstart are
    possible at this time because no fortran examples currently call these
    functions.)

    New Fortran binding: Add remaining API relevant to example 15

    For example 15 I got perfect results (0 errors, no leaks are possible)

    Those svg graphical results agreed exactly with the corresponding svg

    New Fortran binding: plcont fixes and add examples x09f and x14f

    Those fixes were to insert intent(in) for all dummy arguments with the value attribute
    and to install all the module intermediate files (which are not
    required for the gfortran case but which are required for the Intel
    fortran compiler case).  In addition some "only" fixes were required to

commit 797e9ae9a77101bcbc7492b5f8aeed72bf8008fc
Author: Arjen Markus <arjen.markus@deltares.nl>
Date:   Tue Dec 29 09:55:30 2015 +0100

    Implement the new Fortran interface for plcont. This involves defining callback functions - the interface to these functions depends on the actual form they take their data arguments in. This is not entirely ideal as there is more code involved but earlier attempts via type(c_funptr) caused coredumps.

    Some remarks:
    - I had to add a new module - plplot_private_exposed - to accomodate for
      one of the transformation routines. This routine is now exposed to the
      world. If I can get the type(c_funptr) approach to work, then this may
      be eliminated again.
    - The bind(c) attribute is essential, as it changes some of the semantics
      of argument passing. I suspect this caused the earlier coredumps. The
      current implement does its job and it is not too hard to change it again
      if the previous approach works.
    - Be careful to use type(c_ptr) in combination with the value attribute.
      Otherwise you get the address of the pointer instead of the address.
      This is the rather confusing aspect of the C technique to pass a "void *"
      pointer and cast it to something useful.

    That is, I added plscolbga, plsdiori, plsdiplt, plsdiplz, plgfnam, and

    I also fixed variable naming bugs where I forgot the _out suffix, e.g.,

    -    aspect = real(aspect, kind=wp)
    -    jx     = real(jx, kind=wp)
    -    jy     = real(jy, kind=wp)

    +    jx     = real(jx_out, kind=wp)
    +    jy     = real(jy_out, kind=wp)

    in the plgdidev and plgdiori module procedures that had been
    previously implemented but tested for the first time now with example
    31.

    New Fortran binding: Change naming conventions for certain entities

    The plan for the new naming convention is the entities previously
    called plrandd (a function with no arguments that returns a real), PLGraphicsIn (a
    defined type which contains real quantities), and PLNOT_SET, PL_PI,
    and PL_TWOPI (predefined real parameters) where the previous
    associated real precision was plflt will be changed to always be
    double precision regardless of the real precision of the PLplot C
    library.  And the single-precision variants of these same quantities
    will be defined with the names plrandd_single, PLGraphicsIn_single,
    PL_NOTSET_single, PL_PI_single, and PL_TWOPI_single.

    This commit implements this plan for plrandd and PLGraphicsIn.

    I also took this opportunity to add the plgdrawmode API and to make
    private_plflt, private_single, and private_double actually private.
    These changes and the fact that private_plint was already actually
    private required that the real(kind=private_plflt, private_single, or
    private_double) or integer(kind=private_plint) type of result returned
    by the plrandd and plgdrawmode functions had to have a type statement
    in the body of the function rather than as part of the function
    statement. To make that Fortran style uniform I used this form for
    typing all function return values, and appended "!function type" to
    the type statement for this case so it will be easy to find in the
    future.

    New Fortran binding: drop support for kind=plint and kind=plunicode integer Fortran types

    We never implemented such support in a consistent way in any case so
    my judgement is this previous support should be classified as experimental
    and removed now since default integer Fortran types should be fine
    to match the C PLINT and PLUNICODE arguments.

    3 signatures, i.e., no real arguments, double-precision real
    arguments and single-precision real arguments).  The remaining
    API required by example 22 (plcont, plshades, plstransform, and

    unimplemented at this time.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux

    New Fortran binding: Fix matrix_to_c bug and add API relevant to example 21

    The matrix_to_c bug fix patch hunk was

         integer :: i_local

         allocate( carray(size(array,2),size(array,1)) )
    -    allocate( caddress(size(array,2)) )
    +    allocate( caddress(size(array,1)) )

         carray = transpose( array )

    -    do i_local = 1,size(array,2)
    +    do i_local = 1,size(array,1)
             caddress(i_local) = c_loc(carray(1,i_local))
         enddo
     end subroutine matrix_to_c

    The point is that each column of the Fortran carray corresponds to a
    row of the corresponding C array.  Furthermore, the C address of the
    starting location of each column of the Fortran carray (or
    equivalently the C address of the starting location of each row of the
    corresponding C array) must be stored for later C use.  However, the
    size of caddress is the number of columns of carray which is
    size(array,1)) and not size(array,2)), and the do loop must be over
    the range of 1 to size(array,1)) as well.

    The bug in the previous code would have no effect if size(array,2) >
    size(array,1) (other than the caddress array would be larger than
    needed and its trailing (unused) values would be garbage.  However,
    for the case where size(array,2) < size(array,1) the bug in the
    previous code could have severe memory management effects because
    the caddress array would be smaller than what is required by
    the C routine.

    The added API relevant to example 21 was plenv0, and plgriddata.

    I also took the opportunity to change several

    use iso_c_binding

    instances that had crept back in to the appropriate

    use iso_c_binding, only: ...

    form.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by temporarily modifying examples/f95/x21.f90
    to comment out the plshades call, building the x21f95 target,
    and running it with

    valgrind examples/f95/x21f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    That produced perfect (0 errors and no memory leaks are possible)
    valgrind results and also plot file results (for the non-plshades page) that
    agree exactly with the corresponding C pages.

    New Fortran bindings: Add API relevant to example 20

    That API is  plimage, plxormod, plcpstrm, plsfnam, and plxormod.

    I have also modified examples/f95/x20f.f90 to use the double version
    of PlGraphicsIn.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by attempting to build x20f95.  That build failed,
    but only because plimagefr (a function with a callback argument)
    has not been implemented yet.

    New Fortran binding: major style changes + implement plplot_graphics module and API for example 18

    The style changes consist of the following:

    * All formal arguments are declared with an intent attribute as the
      last attribute before the "::".

    * If the value attribute is used, it is placed just before the intent
    attribute

    * All variables that are not formal arguments have names with suffixes
    of "_local" or "_out" to distinguish them from formal arguments.  These
    are the only variables which do not have an intent attribute in their
    declaration.

    * All interface routines whose names were previously prefixed with
    "c_" have had that prefix changed to "interface_"

    The plplot_graphics module adds PLGraphicsIn_single and
    PLGraphicsIn_double types and (buildable but not yet completed, see
    FIXME) module procedures plGetCursor_single and plGetCursor_double
    which are overloaded as plGetCursor.

    The API additions for example 18 are plstring3.

    In addition, I took this opportunity to make the handling of the last
    alt_hue_path argument to plscmap1la (tested in example 30) identical
    to the plscmap1l API, i.e., process this argument as optional.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    with no obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues for our
    standard 3 principal configurations.  The test summary is

    f95
      Missing examples            :  09 14 14a 15 16 19 20 21 22 23 28 31
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    i.e., example 18 has been added to the list of Fortran examples which
    are buildable and which have the same results as the corresponding C
    examples.

    I tested a temporarily modified example 30 to show dropping the
    last optional argument of plscmap1la worked properly.

    For example 18 and unmodified example 30 I got perfect
    results (0 errors, no leaks are possible) for

    valgrind examples/f95/x18f -dev svg -fam -o testf.svg

    and

    New Fortran binding: Drop installion of all PLplot module files other than plplot.mod

    I discovered accidentally that our fortran examples (which only "use
    plplot") can be built in the installed examples tree without access to
    the other module files that are built in the build tree and which are
    used by the plplot module to help build libplplotf95.  I assume this
    is because the details of those other plplot modules that are use(d)
    by the plplot module are made part of the plplot module.  Therefore,
    following the principle of not exposing unneeded details to users, I
    therefore dropped installing all plplot Fortran modules other than
    plplot.mod.

    New Fortran binding: add/fix API required by example 29

    The added API required by example 29 was plbtime, plconfigtime,
    plctime, plssym, and pltimefmt and the fixed API required for example
    29 was plerrx, and plerry (where all arguments of the redacted
    call are now arrays with consistent lengths).

    I also took this opportunity to add plaxes API (which is untested by any
    example) as well as implementing a consistent style for Fortran error messages
    and for processing intent(out) arguments.

    New Fortran binding: Use module procedures to define all parts of the Fortran API

    Code like the following before the "contains"

        interface
            subroutine plbop() bind(c,name='c_plbop')
            end subroutine plbop
        end interface

    has now been replaced by code like the following after the
    "contains"

    subroutine plbop()
        interface
            subroutine interface_plbop() bind(c,name='c_plbop')
            end subroutine interface_plbop
         end interface
         call interface_plbop()
    end subroutine plbop

    This change is more than just a style change because it has an
    important linking effect; "nm --undefined-only" shows all direct
    references to c_plbop, etc., are now gone from the compiled examples
    so it is no longer necessary/desireable to link those examples
    directly with libplplot.  Furthermore, that same command shows there
    are no direct references in the compiled examples to the libplplotf95c
    API.  So I have also changed all Fortran example linking (both
    CMake-based and traditional) to only link directly to libplplotf95,
    and this will be a considerable simplification for our Fortran binding
    users.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by a successful run of

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON  -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_f95=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    Also, ldd -r tests applied to various Fortran libraries/examples for
    the shared case (the only case I tested in detail this way) showed no issues.

    New Fortran binding: Change naming convention for included files

    The previous name convention (that all included files end with the
    ".inc" suffix) gave poor editing results because editors would not
    automatically change to fortran mode when editing those files. The gdb
    debugger also had trouble with recognizing such files as well.

    Therefore I have changed to the naming convention for such
    files that their names are prefixed with "included_" as an indicator
    that they are included files, and suffixed with ".f90" to indicate
    they are Fortran source files.

    I also took this opportunity to add Fortran example 33 to the list
    of tests that are run.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by successfully building the test_diff_psc target.  The summary

    New Fortran binding: Add plcolorbar required by examples 16 and 33

    Also made these additional changes/corrections:

    * Corrected C name for plscolbg from c_plscol0 to c_plscolbg

    * Changed incorrectly spelled "adress" to "address" everywhere
    in the Fortran interface code.

    * Changed use iso_c_binding to always use the only: keyword in the
    most restrictive way possible.

    * Use appropriate kind parameter on passed length of character arrays.

    * Corrected plsmaj, plsmin, and plspage to use value attribute to
    avoid passing garbage to the corresponding C routine.  I chased
    this particular plsmaj bug (whose symptom was missing tick marks) a long
    time before I finally spotted the missing "value" attributes
    in all three of these routines.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by succesfully building the x33f95 target and running

    valgrind examples/f95/x33f -dev psc -o testf.psc

    The valgrind report was perfect (0 errors and no leaks are possible)
    and the result agreed exactly (except for date stamp) with
    the result from the corresponding C example.

    I also attempted to build x16f95.  That build failed only because
    Fortran versions of plcont and plshades are not available yet.

    to the new binding, but not plcont and plshades (other API currently
    missing for example 16), and plcolorbar (other API missing for both
    examples 16 and 33).

    N.B. this is a backwards-incompatible API change for Fortran plspal1
    where the last argument type has been changed from integer to logical
    to be consistent with the PLBOOL type of the corresponding
    argument of the C routine.

    run-time issues with plscmap1_range, plsmaj, plsmin, plspal0, and

    Fortran binding: Implement pllegend

    The transformation of the two Fortran character array arguments must be
    done in C, so the complete interfacing solution for the Fortran
    version of pllegend requires calling a fc_pllegend C wrapper for the C
    version of pllegend.

    I deliberately introduced two backwards incompatible changes for this
    implementation to be consistent with the remaining Fortran API.

    1. Only the redacted form of Fortran pllegend (with redundant nlegend
    dropped from the argument list) was implemented.

    2. In that redacted form nlegend is determined from the size
    of one of the arrays, but the rest are checked to have consistent
    sizes.

    These changes required that both Fortran standard examples 4 and 26 had
    to be changed.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the test_diff_psc target.  The
    results summary was

    previously had differing graphical output) now agree

    Fortran binding: move code in plparsopts.f90 into plplot_bindings.f90

    The motivation for this change is there is no reason to keep
    plparseopts implemented in a separate file, and having all the
    non-real Fortran API defined in one file makes it easier to do overall
    modern Fortran style changes.

    Fortran binding: Rename plplot_interfaces.inc -> plplot_real_interfaces.inc

    The motivation for this renaming is this file is exclusively concerned
    with the PLplot Fortran interfaces for the subset of the API that
    has real arguments.  The interfaces where the API has no real arguments
    are implemented separately in plplot_bindings.f90.

    Fortran binding: Initial implementation of libplplotf95c, the C part of the interface for the new binding

    Some aspects of implementing the new Fortran binding cannot be handled
    completely by the iso_c_binding Fortran module capabilities.  A good
    example of this is the transformation of a blank-padded character
    array Fortran argument to the required C array of pointers to
    null-terminated character strings argument of plparsopts.  I have
    dealt with this issue by implementing in the new plplotf95c C library
    a C function to make the required argument transformation, and a
    fc_plparseopts function that calls that transformation function and
    then calls plparseopts with its argument in the correct (transformed)
    form.

    Because of this correct implementation of Fortran plparseopts
    I was able to reinstate calling plparseopts for
    examples/f95/x00f.f90, and test (see below) building and running
    the Fortran examples (in the form they all had before the start of
    this topic branch) with the new binding.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    attempting to build the test_diff_psc target.  Roughly ~60 per cent of
    the examples did not build (typically because of certain parts of the
    Fortran API that are currently missing from the new binding), but once
    those examples were eliminated from the build list and run list, then
    I could build the test_diff_psc target with the following result:

    f95
      Missing examples            :  09 10 11 13 14 14a 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 28 29 31 33
      Differing graphical output  :  04 26
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    where the missing examples are the ones that do not yet build.  There
    is obviously still quite a bit of work to do, but nevertheless the
    examples that do build and have no differences with the equivalent C
    results (i.e., 00 01 02 03 05 06 07 08 12 24 25 27 30) are a
    promising start for the new Fortran binding, and the rest of this
    project will simply consist of eliminating the problems that cause the
    above differing graphical output and missing examples.

    Fortran binding: Fix example build and run-time errors for the new binding

    The fixes were the following:

    * Name the C version of plparseopts correctly (as c_plparseopts and not f_plparseopts)

    * Link the examples to both the plplotf95 and plplot libraries.  The
    latter is required by the iso_c_binding method.  Very shortly (see
    below) the plplotf95c library (the part of the Fortran interface that
    is too complicated to be handled by the iso_c_binding method so it
    must be written in C) will be added to the list of libraries that must
    be linked.

    * Temporarily drop the call to plparseopts in examplex/f95/x00f.f90.

    This change is not needed to build that example, but it is needed to
    run it.  Otherwise, the plparseopts call in this (and other examples)
    currently just segfaults.  The issue is that plparseopts must interface an array
    of character strings from fortran to C.  That complicated interfacing
    task cannot be done by the iso_c_binding module and instead must be
    done at the C level in the the planned small plplotf95c library that
    will now be needed again.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the ps and x00f95 targets and then running

    valgrind examples/f95/x00f

    (note no command line arguments are used because plparseopts is
    temporarily not called in this example in order to get it to run
    without segfaults.  The PostScript results looked good (after entering
    the device and output file by hand), the valgrind report was pristine
    (no errors, no leaks possible), and the ldd -r test gave clean results
    as well.

    Fortran binding: Fix the last of the current set of build errors for libplplotf95

    The fixes were to implement the definition of the maxlen parameter
    (which is required by plparseopts) before the contains in the plplot
    module, and the removal of "use plplot" from plparseopts which is one
    of the files that are included in the plplot module beyond the
    contains statement.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the plplotf95 target.  Note, however, that the
    test_diff_psc target still does not work because the Fortran
    examples are linked with both the plplotf95 and plplotf95c libraries
    and the latter does not exist (yet) in the new Fortran binding.

    Fortran binding: remove plplot_types.f90.in file that was added in error to the new binding

    I added this file to the new binding because it was configured by
    bindings/f95/CMakeLists.txt, but it defines a plplot_types module in
    nameclash conflict with the plplot_types module defined in
    plplot_bindings.f90 and the latter definition should be the module
    that is used for the new binding Therefore remove this file as well as
    the bindings/f95/CMakeLists.txt references to it.

    N.B. The new Fortran binding still does not build, but the removal of
    this confusion between two modules with identical names has
    substantially reduced the build errors.

    Fortran binding: add missing files to the new binding

    Arjen made two attempts to implement this new binding. These 4 files
    that are required by his second attempt are missing from that
    attempt so I copied them from his first attempt.

    N.B. This commit completes Arjen's most recent work on this topic.
    However, this new Fortran binding still does not build ("use plplot"
    inside the plplot module and maxlen not defined) so I plan some
    immediate additional changes to address these issues.

    Created a PlDevice class, separate from wxPLDevice, fixed wx aspect
    problems and text height

    Unfortunately this commit ended up including multiple items that I
    couldn't disentangle. The initial plan was to create a PlDevice C++
    class which can be used as a base class for wxPLDevice and other
    future drivers. In particular I plan to split the wxDevice into
    two, one where a wxDC is passed in and one which uses the viewer.
    However I ended up moving some of the wxWidgets text code around
    and then ended up fixing a long standing aspect ratio problem too.

    Regarding the PlDevice class, this class is still declared in
    wxwidgets.h. It mostly consists of some virtual method declarations
    and very little code. The only code I did move into this class was
    the code which parses text into lines and line sections. The
    conversion to wxString still occurs in this code and it uses
    wxCoord, so it is not entirely wxWidgets free, but I will deal with
    these later.

    The moving around of the text code, made me change how text
    transforms are performed and caused me to look into a previous
    wxWidgets driver aspect ratio bug. In the end I found that this was
    caused by the wxPLplotwindow not being created with the intended
    size (it was resized to that size later) and this caused plinit to
    be called with the wrong aspect ratio. The wcPLplotwindow class has
    had a size parameter added to its constructor to fx this.

    I also found that wxWidgets reports the total line spacing as line
    height, not just the ascender as assumed in the text size
    calculations. This has been fixed.

    Core library: modify plmap code so that the library rather than examples emits warning messages concerning missing resources/capabilities

    This change is a fix for the previous approach which used the
    PL_USE_SHAPEFILES macro in examples to decide what warnings to emit, but
    such a macro-based approach does not work for languages other than C
    or C++ so we have now removed all references to PL_USE_SHAPEFILES
    in the C and C++ examples (as well as the rest of our source tree).

    Furthermore, I have now factored the src/plmap.c file so
    that src/plmap.c is exclusively concerned with the shapelib
    approach and therefore no longer has any reference to the old deprecated
    plmap approach, and src/deprecated_plmap.c is exclusively concerned
    with the old deprecated plmap approach and has no reference to
    the modern shapelib approach.  The build system has been adjusted so
    that when PL_DEPRECATED=OFF (the usual default) only the plmap.c code
    and not deprecated_plmap.c is compiled into libplplot, and when PL_DEPRECATED=ON
    only deprecated_plmap.c and not plmap.c is compiled into libplplot.

    We discuss 3 cases:

    I. PL_DEPRECATED=OFF, HAVE_SHAPELIB=ON
    II. PL_DEPRECATED=OFF, HAVE_SHAPELIB=OFF
    III. PL_DEPRECATED=ON

    Case I.

    This the usual case and it gives good results with no warning messages
    for all pages of example 19.

    Case II.

    For this case most of the code in plmap.c is ignored by the
    preprocessor (because the macro HAVE_SHAPELIB corresponding to the
    CMake variable of the same name is not #defined).  Thus, the only code that
    is left all the plmap* functions which
    simply emit a warning message similar to

    *** PLPLOT WARNING ***
    plmap is a no-op because shapelib is not available.

    and return.  Also, for what it is worth the plmeridians function is
    available.

    The net result for example 19 for Case II is as expected; all the
    boxes are blank on each page of this example except for the
    plmeridians results for two of them and "Baltimore" string for one of
    them. Also a warning message similar to the above is emitted by the
    library (not the example!) each time example 19 calls any of the
    plmap* functions.

    Case III.

    For this case, the code in deprecated_plmap.c is used which makes no
    reference to shapelib functionality or HAVE_SHAPELIB at all so you get
    the same result regardless of whether HAVE_SHAPELIB is OFF or ON.  The
    plmap function does plot the maps of the first 4 pages of example 19
    using the old-fashioned non-shapelib method and data, but the rest of
    the plmap* functions simply emit a warning similar to

    *** PLPLOT WARNING ***
    plmapfill not available when the -DPL_DEPRECATED=ON cmake option is used.

    The net result for example 19 case III is as expected; the first four
    pages of the example are plotted without issues or warning messages,
    and the last shapelib-related page plots a blank box and the library
    (not the example!) emits warning messages of the above type every time any plmap*
    function is called in that example page. (Note, plmap itself is not
    called by that page.)

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin ,airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie).  For each of Cases I, II, and III, the expected
    results as described above were obtained and the command

    valgrind examples/c/x19c -dev svg -fam -o testc.svg

    gave a perfect report (0 errors, no leaks are possible).

    Restructured the wxWidgets text size again and remove tests for
    wxGraphicsContext

    It seems that although the previous solution worked it is not supported
    to create wxBitmaps or wxMemoryDCs in a console app. It is however
    supported (although it seems undocumented) to create wxGraphicsContexts
    from a wxImage in a console application - see
    http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/17319 and
    http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/17320

    Also removed all checks for wxUSE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT because this is now
    supposedly set to 1 for all wxWidget platforms and also because there is
    no officially supported fallback.

    In the wxWidgets driver only use wxGraphicContext under Windows

    Ideally we want to use a wxGraphicsContext (wxGCDC) to determine the
    size of text because that is what is used in wxPLViewer. However under
    Linux creation of the wxGrahicsContext causes a crash. It might be that
    this is only for wxGTK2, not wxGTK3 as wxWidgets does slightly different
    things for these two cases, but until I have access to a GTK3 machine
    for testing I can't be sure.
    So for all OSs other than Windows we do the text measuring using a
    wxMemoryDC. For Windows we use a wxGCDC.

    Sort wxWidget initialization

    In order to call GUI functions there appears to be a need for some
    initialization which results from the creation of a wxApp. This seems to
    be the case on Linux when creating wxFonts (which we need to be able to
    do to get text sizes), although Windows seems less fussy. However, we
    don't want to start the message loop,
    so rather than using one of the wxWidget macros we just create and
    initialize a default wxApp without calling wxApp::OnRun, which is the
    function which begins the message loop.

    Fix the interactive text wxBitmap at 24 bpp

    Using the screen depth does not work on Linux as wxWidgets tries to
    derive this from the top level window which doesn't exist. This causes a
    crash. It doesn't actually matter what bit depth is used as the bitmap
    is never actually drawn on - it just allows a valid wxMemoryDC to be
    constructed for defining text size.

    Changed strategy to get text size in wxWidgets driver

    The delay in getting the text size from the wxPLViewer has been of
    concern. Doing this required both the calling application and the viewer
    to repeatedly poll the shared memory checking for updates which can
    introduce significant delays. We now create a memory DC in the driver to
    use specifically for getting text size when the user does not pass in a
    wxDC.

    Core library: move the warning concerning a NULL pltr callback from plcont to plfcont

    plcont calls plfcont immediately with unchanged callback argument so
    moving the warning to the latter function provides the warning for
    both functions. Previously, the warning was only emitted for the
    plcont call so a direct call to plfcont (which unconditionally
    executes the callback) would previously have had run-time errors with
    a NULL callback.

    Build fix for C++ example 20: revert back to previous termination method if lena.pgm cannot be found

    That is, the termination method is changed as follows:

    -                fprintf(stderr, "No such file");
    -                plend();
    -                exit(1);
    +                cout << "No such file - aborting" << endl;
    +                delete pls;
    +                exit( 1 );

    The "delete pls" not only terminates pls properly (including an
    internal call to plend) but also eliminates the erroneous direct call
    to the libplplot routine plend.  That direct call meant that example
    20 failed to build since like all other C++ examples it is
    deliberately linked directly just to libplplotcxx and not libplplot.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by building the test_diff_psc target with the
    following expected perfect C++ results:

    c++
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    Furthermore, I used valgrind to run C++ example 20 from the top-level
    build tree (as it happens for the "-dev svg -fam" options) and got the
    expected (from the above change) "No such file - aborting" message as
    well as perfect (0 errors, no leaks are possible) valgrind results.  I
    also did the same thing from within the examples/c++ directory for the
    case when that file was available and again got perfect valgrind
    results.

    Removed named mutex for perfomance boost to the wxWidgets driver.

    As far as I can tell the mutex used in wxPLDevice::TransmitBuffer is not
    needed as the buffer records the read and write positions and avoids
    overtaking that way. Generating this mutex adds about 25% overhead on
    Windows. Not sure about the overhead in Linux, but hopefuly this will
    help performance issues reported by Alan.

    Ada language support: Update CMAKE_Ada_CREATE_SHARED_LIBRARY and CMAKE_Ada_CREATE_SHARED_MODULE for the Mac OS X case

    This change is necessary to get the new Ada language support to work
    on Mac OS X.  The change follows the special support for C, CXX, and
    Fortran in CMake's installed version of Modules/Platform/Darwin.cmake
    where that special support for those languages has not changed since
    CMake-3.0.2.

    Tested by: Jerry Bauck <jbauck@users.sourceforge.net> on Mac OS X
    10.9.5 "Mavericks" for both the AdaCore version of Ada-4.7.4 and the
    FSF version of Ada-4.9.1.  The successful tests that were performed
    for each Ada install was to configure, build, run, and test the
    test_ada project at cmake/test_ada following the directions at
    cmake/test_ada/README for both the shared build and static build
    cases.  Note this is a direct test that the basic Ada language support
    works for the extremely simple cmake/test_ada project that creates an
    Ada library that writes out "hello, world" and an Ada executable that
    calls that library.  So this is naturally not as comprehensive as the
    test below, but it is an excellent sign that the more comprehensive
    test below will work on Mac OS X once Jerry is in position to try it.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    (Debian jessie) by running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_test_interactive no --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_ada=ON"

    with no configure, build, or run-time issues for all comprehensive
    testing configurations.  Note, this is a comprehensive test of the Ada
    language support files at cmake/modules/language_support/cmake which
    are identical (except for one line concerning the location of the
    support files) with the files at cmake/test_ada/Modules that were
    tested by Jerry.

    test_ada and PLplot Ada language support: adopt .o extension for object files for all platforms

    Contrary to C++ (and other mainstream compilers) where this extension
    is either .o for Unix or .obj otherwise we have evidence on both MinGW
    (from years ago with a fix implemented in the old Ada language
    support) and MinGW-w64 (now for the new Ada language support where
    this fix is now required) that this extension is always .o for Ada
    regardless of platform.  So use that assumption unless or until we
    find a platform where that assumption is not correct (i.e., one where
    the error message "gnat1: incorrect object file extension" is emitted
    by the gnat1 Ada compiler front-end to the gcc compiler.

    Update C example 7 to include a plptex Hershey escape sequence debugging mode

    The introduced -plptex_mode example option replaces the plsym call by
    the largely equivalent plptex call.  This change does not need to be
    propagated to non-C languages. The intention of this debugging mode is
    to allow direct comparison of plsym results (which use Hershey fonts
    directly) with the corresponding plptex results for the equivalent
    Hershey code.

    For device drivers that use Hershey fonts (e.g., the xwin device) the
    results with and without the -plptex_mode option are identical aside
    from occasional horizontal offsets that typically are too small to be
    seen but which for certain characters can be as large as 1/20th the
    box width.  Despite those relatively large offsets in a minority of
    cases, the only hypothesis I have to explain this difference is the
    possibility of different internal coordinate systems and rounding of
    those positional results.  But why are the large offsets only in X,
    but not Y?  Anyhow, this is an issue that should be revisited once we
    review and completely update the internal coordinate systems for
    PLplot to not be limited to just 16-bit integers.

    For unicode-aware devices (such as -dev qtwidget), there is a
    translation done internally between Hershey escape sequences (as in
    the present very extensive example when -plptex_mode is used) and
    equivalent unicode.  And for -dev ps and -dev psc there is a further
    translation between that derived unicode result and the corresponding
    Type 1 Adobe font code for characters.  So to further debug the
    Hershey-to-unicode transformation, it is planned to compare example 7
    results with and without -plptex_mode for -dev qtwidget and to further
    debug the Unicode to type1 transformation, the equivalent experimenet
    is planned for -dev ps.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    comparing -dev xwin results for example 7 with and without the new
    -plptex_mode option with results that have been described above.
    Additional systematic testing using this mode is planned (also
    described above).  One of those planned comparisons (for the -dev psc
    device) has already been spot checked for the "#(855)" case, and as
    currently discussed on the plplot-devel list, the plsym result shows
    the Hershey font arrow while the plptex result shows a blank (unlike
    other devices).  I am virtually positive this difference is due to a
    missing entry in the Unicode to type1 transformation table, but it is
    also probable this is a result of no glyph to represent an arrowhead
    in the set of 35 standard type 1 fonts, i.e., this is an artifact of
    the limitations of Type 1 fonts.

    PLplot core library: remove octal number interpretation for numerical escape sequences

    The long-standing but undocumented octal possibility for numerical
    escape sequences (first introduced in 2008, but just brought to my
    attention now) concerns the semantics of the strtoul C library
    function (used in text2num which in turn is used in the chain of calls
    from plptex, plptex3, plmtex, and plmtex3, but not plsym).

    Previously the base in the strtoul call was set to 0.  Here is what
    the strtoul Linux man page says about that case:

    "If base is zero or 16, the string may then include a "0x" prefix, and
    the number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken as
    10 (decimal) unless the next character is '0', in which case it is
    taken as 8 (octal)."

    Furthermore, my experiments and also some of the man pages for strtoul
    on the web (e.g., <http://illumos.org/man/3C/strtoul>) indicate the
    Linux man page should state that strtoul interprets both "0x" and "0X"
    as the hexadecimal case.  So for base 0, the strtoul interpretation of
    numbers assumes a base following exactly what is done for C numerical
    constants.

    But that "feature" contradicts our documentation where hexadecimal and
    decimal possibilities are documented (e.g., in
    <http://plplot.sourceforge.net/docbook-manual/plplot-html-5.11.1/characters.html>
    for the present release), but the octal possibility is undocumented.
    Furthermore, newbie C programmers and programmers who have no
    experience with C may be surprised by that octal interpretation.  For
    example, before the present fix the Hershey encoding sequence
    "#(0855)" (the one where I discovered this issue) chokes on the 8
    because of the octal interpretation due to that leading zero, and such
    users will experience even a larger surprise when they discover that,
    e.g., "#(0123)" and "#(123)" silently give very different results
    because of the respective octal (because of the leading zero) and
    decimal interpretations.

    Accordingly, instead of documenting this feature, I have made the
    choice to remove the octal intepretation from our code (by setting
    base for the strtoul call to 10 unless the string prefix is 0x or 0X
    in which case base is set to 16).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    some modified C examples where plptex and plmtex calls included
    Hershey escape sequences with leading 0's (those numbers interpreted
    now as decimal rather than the previous octal) and both leading 0x and
    0X (those numbers interpreted as hexadecimal as always).

    test_ada and PLplot Ada language support: restore explicit linking of Ada libraries to libgnat

    This change solves an underlinking issue for the Ada libraries that
    was nonconsequential on Linux (except that ldd -r on Ada libraries
    revealed the issue) but which caused a build error on Cygwin.

    On all platforms use the PRIVATE CMake keyword for the
    target_link_libraries command used to link the Ada library with
    libgnat.  That means that Ada applications that are linked to the Ada
    library will not be overlinked to libgnat.

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using
    CMake-3.3.2 (built using the bootstrap procedure).

    For the test_ada project I followed the test procedure documented in
    cmake/test_ada/README. The configuration with cmake, build, run-time,
    valgrind, and ldd -r results (including ldd -r on the Ada library and
    Ada executable) were all clean.

    For the PLplot project I used the cmake options
    -DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON
    -DENABLE_ada=ON to limit the test to Ada and built the
    test_noninteractive target in the build tree using VERBOSE=1 without
    any obvious configuration, build, or run-time issues and with the
    usual

    Comparison test using psc device

    results.  In addition, the VERBOSE=1 build results revealed (as
    expected from using the PRIVATE keyword) no underlinking of libgnat
    for the Ada library and no overlinking of libgnat for any of the Ada
    thin or thick examples. Furthermore, ldd -r gave good results on both
    the Ada library and all Ada examples.

    in cmake/modules/language_support.cmake and examples/CMakeLists.txt;

    4. updating cmake/modules/ada.cmake and bindings/ada/CMakeLists.txt to
    drop all logic concerning GNAT_LIB since for the new Ada language
    support we no longer search for the gnat library or explicitly
    link to it.

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_test_interactive no --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_ada=ON"

    These comprehensive test options drop everything other than what is
    required for comprehensive testing of the Ada component in the
    interests of speeding up the test. This test showed no configuration,
    build, or run-time errors, and also yielded for all the 12 different
    test cases the following comparison results with C:

    test_ada Ada language support: Do not explicitly link the library to libgnat

    This change means the created Ada library will have some unresolved
    references (as revealed by (ldd -r src_lib/libhello.so), but
    apparently the Ada builder (gnatmake) used to build Ada executables
    that link to Ada libraries knows how to link libgnat in properly for
    the executable (as revealed by ldd -r src_executable/hello), the
    explicit linking required finding the gnat library (which required
    some complications which have now all been removed), and there is a
    possibility that current Cygwin build issues for the executable are
    being caused by the explicit linking of the library (or else because
    the wrong gnat library was being found on that platform).

    test_ada Ada language support: Do not enable C

    This simplification of the test_ada project means life is a bit
    more complex for testers of this project since CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
    must be set in order to find libgnat for this special case where
    none of the core languages (C, CXX, Fortran) are enabled.  But
    this change is fully documented in cmake/test_ada/README.

    CMake-3.3.2 (built using the bootstrap procedure) following the test
    procedure documented in cmake/test_ada/README. The configuration with

    This changes means that compiler-specific information such as

    On some platforms (e.g., Cygwin and Windows),
    CMAKE_Ada_LINK_EXECUTABLE is set by default with completely wrong form

    Test Ada language support: Add platform files

    These platform files add platform-dependent tweaks to the Ada language
    support. In all cases I followed exactly (except for substituting Ada
    for CXX) what was done for the CXX equivalent using CMake-supplied
    language-support infrastructure macros, but these platform tweaks have
    only been so far tested (see below) on Linux where for that case they
    didn't appear to make any important difference.  But my hope (i.e., I
    did not wade through the logic to confirm this) is the tweaks in the
    Cygwin and MinGW (Windows) cases will sort out any issues with
    generating the import library form of the shared library that was
    missing before for Cygwin and which also might be an issue for
    MinGW-w64/MSYS2 and/or MinGW/MSYS.

    Experimental test Ada language support: add gcc to the list of compilers

    When gcc is on the list (and for the case where ccache is installed)
    the resulting Ada compiler is /usr/lib/ccache/gcc.  Previously I
    thought that would be an issue, but evidentally (see test below) it is
    not, i.e., the ccache result is the same as if /usr/bin/gcc (which is
    a symlink to gcc-4.9) had been used for the compiler. (Note the
    alternative Ada compiler name gnatgcc is also a symlink to gcc-4.9 on
    Debian Jessie).

    Tested by Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    using the -DEXPERIMENTAL_SUPPORT=ON cmake option (which tests the
    language support in cmake_experimental rather than cmake_working)
    while otherwise following the test procedure documented in
    cmake/test_ada/README.  For CMake-3.3.2 (built using the bootstrap
    procedure) the run-time, valgrind, and ldd -r results were clean.

    Rewrite experimental test Ada language support

    This rewrite is based on Ada modifications to the modern
    (CMake-3.4.0-rc3) C++ language support with good notes concerning all
    the C++ to Ada changes so it should be much easier to understand than
    the old Ada language support which was poorly documented and based on
    what CMake provided in terms of language support from a decade ago.

    This new Ada language support is currently only in
    cmake/test_ada/cmake_experimental and has not yet been propagated to
    PLplot itself.  Also, like the old Ada language support it does not yet
    provide a means to create the necessary import library for the shared
    case on Windows platforms such as Cygwin.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    using the -DEXPERIMENTAL_SUPPORT=ON cmake option (which tests the
    language support in cmake_experimental rather than cmake_working)
    while otherwise following the test procedure documented in
    cmake/test_ada/README.  For cmake-3.0.2 (the official Debian Jessie
    version) and CMake-3.3.2 and CMake-3.4.0-rc3 (both built by myself
    using the bootstrap procedure) the run-time, valgrind, and ldd -r
    results were clean.

    The issue was if extXdrawable_demo is not built for some reason (such
    as the Cygwin package for gtk+ not correctly depending on the
    libxrandr package) then the extXdrawable_demo target does not exist
    and the test_extXdrawable target should not be built for this case.  A
    simple change (adding AND TARGET extXdrawable_demo) to an if statement
    controlling whether test_extXdrawable is built) fixed this issue, and
    my thanks to Greg for running the Cygwin test that found this issue.

    The exceptions are the Linux or Cygwin platforms where the minimum
    CMake version remains at 3.0.2 (to accomodate using system versions of
    CMake for Cygwin and most modern Linux distributions).  In addition,
    in the Linux or Cygwin case, the user is warned if they have a CMake
    version between 3.2.0 and 3.3.1 because of a regression for that range
    of CMake versions (corrected in 3.3.2) that compromised the find
    ability of cmake.

    (Those issues for examples 8 and 19 are long-standing ones.)

    Also for both versions of CMake I followed
    the directions in cmake/test_ada/README to build and test the test_ada project
    for both the static and shared libraries case.  Those tests gave the
    expected "hello, world" results.

    Build system: Complete rewrite of file and target dependency logic for test targets

    The test issue that lead me to open this whole can of worms was that
    wxPLViewer was not being built as a necessary dependency for
    wxwidgets tests for ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF.  I was trying to use
    target dependencies to force wxPLViewer to be built before the
    wxwidgets target, but that idea obviously does not work correctly
    for ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF since the wxwidgets target
    does not exist for that case (i.e., the wxwidgets device driver
    is part of the core plplot library in this case).

    So the proper way to deal with this issue is to have wxwidgets
    tests depend on the wxPLViewer target, but once I started reviewing
    target dependencies of tests, I realized the CMake logic
    implementing that had to be rewritten so that custom test targets
    associated with interactive tests that normally do not have a
    corresponding custom command should not have any DEPENDS and instead
    add_dependencies should be used appropriately for that case.  The
    single "virgin" tests below also showed a large number of target
    dependency issues that had to be addressed.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux. I
    performed "virgin" tests (i.e., where the test target was built alone
    starting from an empty build tree without any other test target
    obfuscating whether the particular single target dependencies are
    properly built or not) on a subset of the noninteractive tests and on
    essentially all interactive tests for both the ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=ON
    and ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF cases.  I also ran the following two
    comprehensive tests:

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_test_interactive no
    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_ctest no --do_test_noninteractive no

    which is essentially equivalent to running

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh

    Build system: Disable OCAML_HAS_CAIRO

    I have taken this step because substantial maintenance will be
    required before this component of PLplot will configure, build, or run
    again because of backwards incompatibilities that have been introduced
    in ocaml support of cairo. For example, the package name "cairo2" no
    longer exists any more and should probably be replaced by the package
    name cairo, but that is just the start of the backwards
    incompatibilities.

    Device drivers and core library: update centralized default settings for plspage

    Used more rationalized names for plspage default values and propagated
    those to the cgm, gd, and wxwidgets devices that currently use
    centralized default setting.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    building against epa_built gtk+ version 3 and wxwidgets (so that I can
    build and test wxwidgets) and also using the configuration options
    -DDEFAULT_ALL_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_plmeta=OFF to allow building all
    devices.  After building all devices and examples with "make -j4 all",
    I ran the second example for the cgm, png (from gd device driver), and
    wxwidgets devices for a variety of -geometry and -dpi values.

    All three of these devices have length units of pixels.  So for my
    monitor whose actual dpi value of 90 matches the default assumed by
    PLplot, the actual default sizes of these three devices should be A5,
    and I have confirmed that which is the principal desired result
    for using centralized default settings for plspage.

    If I specify -geometry the size changes as expected for -dev wxwidgets
    and -dev gd, but there is some bug in cgm where the size remains the
    default but the resolution decays.

    If I specify a -dpi value, the character size changes as expected for
    wxwidgets since the character size specified in mm should be converted
    to pixels using this dpi value.  However, an unexpected result is both
    -dev cgm and -dev png results seem unaffected by -dpi value.  I don't
    completely understand the code paths that are used for the pure
    Hershey text processing used for -dev cgm or the plfreetype unicode
    processing used for -dev png.  However, one explanation of these
    results is there are dpi-related bugs in these code paths.

    When recently updating the documentation of the plfreetype approach I
    forgot that the cgm device driver uses Hershey fonts alone and does
    not use the plfreetype approach despite its other similarities with
    the gd device driver.  Correct that by dropping cgm from the discussion
    of the plfreetype approach.

    Build system: refine what gets dropped when -DDROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS=ON

    The purpose of -DDROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS=ON is to drop GTK+ version 2
    components from a GTK+ version 3 build on those platforms (e.g., where
    epa_build has been used to provide GTK+ version 3 libraries but the
    system libraries are still GTK+ version 2) where both GTK+ versions 2
    and 3 are available.

    This fix refines what is dropped.  Previously, anything having to do
    with xcairo was dropped, e.g., the xcairo device and the
    extXdrawable_demo application.  The extXdrawable_demo is indeed a pure
    GTK+ version 2 application, but when GTK+ version 3 is available the
    xcairo device is pure GTK+ version 3.  So for
    -DDROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS=ON do not allow extXdrawable_demo to be built
    but do allow the xcairo device to be built.

    Build system: Finish retiring wxpng device

    To minimally (i.e., no source code changes) retire a device you have
    to (a) comment it out of cmake/modules/drivers-init.cmake (already
    done in commit 6f80549) and (b) modify
    drivers/<device_name>.driver_info.in to remove the device from the
    list of devices if there are some left as in the wxwidgets device
    driver case.  That change to finish retiring the wxpng device is what
    was done in this commit.

    This commit (and commit a6d2a439 to fix a wxwidgets build issue for
    the Linux g++ compiler) allows wxwidgets-related PLplot software to
    build again on Linux.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> by building
    essentially all components (including wxwidgets-related components) of
    PLplot on Linux.  Since the minimum acceptable wxwidgets version is
    3.0.0 which is not available as a system library on my Debian oldstable
    platform, the build was configured to use an epa_built
    wxwidgets-3.0.2 library using appropriate PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variables to help CMake find that
    epa_built version of wxwidgets, and its epa_built gtk+ library
    dependencies while using

    export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1

    to quiet spurious dbus run-time warnings concerning the epa_built gtk+ libraries.
    The CMake (3.2.3) special configuration options were

    -DBUILD_TEST=ON
    -DDEFAULT_ALL_DEVICES=ON
    -DPLD_plmeta=OFF
    -DDROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS=ON

    to build all components of PLplot except for plmeta (which has a build
    issue currently being investigated by Jim Dishaw).  The
    -DDROP_GTK_PLUS_2_BUILDS=ON option is necessary to drop gtk+ version 2
    components of PLplot that are inconsistent with the epa_built gtk+
    version 3 libraries.  The actual build was done using

    make -j4 all >& all.out

    with no build issues (especially for wxwidgets) being reported.

    Fixed 3d text in wxWidgets driver - but with a fudge.

    It seems that the rotated text code only uses device coordinates.
    Because the wxWidgets driver reports the same device size (max int) in
    each direction, this causes issues.
    By contrast the rotated text uses mm sizes. Because we report different
    device pixels per mm for x and y this worked fine.
    To fix this we report identical pixels per mm in both directions then
    make a correction to the rotation and shear angles in DrawText()

    Rewrite of the wxWidgets text processing methods

    The text processing routines were left unchanged in the recent driver
    rewrite. The changes simplify the code, making it more readable. This
    change fixes two bugs from the tracker:
    subscript and superscript scales and offsets, however a multiple of
    0.75 is made to the offset otherwise it doesn't match other devices
    and just looks too large (it is 100% of the text height otherwise).
    which copied the text into the memory buffer had been somehow delete so
    wxPLViewer always saw an empty string.

    In terms of restructuring. The text is dealt with in three stages, as
    before, but the responsibilites of each stage are more clearly defined.

    DrawText receives the full string. It sets up the dc state to be ready
    to render text. It only sets up items that cannot be changed mid string.
    It splits the string into lines and passes each line to DrawLine.

    DrawTextLine converts the 32 bit ucs4 encoded string into a wxString. As
    it does so it parses escape sequences and breaks the string at format
    changes. Each of these sections is then passed to DrawTextSection.

    DrawTextSection is dumb in that it has no concept of formatting. It
    simply draws the text that it is tolde to, where it is told to draw it.
    It has no concept of formatting such as superscript. It's only
    responsibility is to select the font based on the given fci and size
    and then draw the text/calculate the text size.

    It should be noted that there is a commented out peice of code in
    DrawText that corrects for aspect ratio of the plot based on the
    assumption that plplot core code thought the plot was square. This fixes
    3d text, but breaks regular 2d rotated text. The final solution of how
    to deal with this needs further exploration of the core code to discover
    why.

    Device drivers: Replace PLPLOT_DEFAULT_DPI with PLPLOT_DEFAULT_PIXPI

    PLPLOT_DEFAULT_PIXPI is used to define the default 90 pixels per inch
    used for devices with dimensions measured in pixels.

    In addition define PLPLOT_DEFAULT_MMPI which is intended to be the
    default 25.4 mm/inch used to determine the real-world units per inch
    for devices with dimensions measured in real-world units (points =
    1/72 inch, mm, cm, inches, etc.).  Only in bizarre circumstances would
    this default value be overridden by the user of these kinds of
    devices.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the cgm, png (from gd device drivers), and wxwidgets
    devices, and running example 2 for all those devices.

    Fix wxwidgets dpi/size bug

    The issue was the if ( !plsc->pageset ) logic to decide whether
    to set default (pixel) width and height since the -dpi option for
    example, calls plspage and sets plsc->pageset even when width and
    height are still at zero!  So that logic is now replaced by correct
    if ( pls->xlength == 0 || pls->ylength == 0 ) logic.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the second example and wxwidgets and then running

    examples/c/x02c -dev wxwidgets -dpi 45.

    which indeed doubles the size of characters as expected from the
    rewritten dpi documentation.  Before the current fix this test failed

    Build system and epa_build: Changes that make epa_built octave binding of PLplot work

    The changes consist of the following:

    1. Build system bug fix: replace all PATHS by HINTS in the find commands used to
    find octave components.  This insures a consistent find result when
    searching for a special version of octave that is not in one of the
    standard locations.  This fix solves a segfault that otherwise occurs
    when PLplot attempts to use the epa_built version of octave.

    2. epa_build: Decrement octave version to 3.8.2 from 4.0.0. This may
    not have been necessary to get a good result since the previous 4.0.0
    segfaults for octave PLplot examples were likely due to issue 1.
    Nevertheless, octave-4.0.0 is backwards-incompatible with octave-3.x.y
    so the more conservative choice is to try octave-3.8.2 for now.

    3. epa_build: update plplot and plplot_lite configurations to use
    epa_built octave.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the test_noninteractive target in the build tree of
    an epa_built plplot_lite that depends on epa_built octave.
    There were no run-time issues at all, and the octave and C results for
    the standard examples were identical.

    Added default page sizes to plplotP.h

    drivers which use pixel pages (e.g. the Cairo or the interactive
    drivers). The mm page size is A4 as this is the most commonly used
    metric paper size used. The pixel size is approximately A5 when scaled
    using the default 90 dpi. This was chosen as it has the same aspect
    ratio as the mm size, but fits comfortably on most computer screens.

    Documentation changed for plspage and setchr

    After some discussion it has been agreed that we need to standardise the
    text and page sizing accross drivers. These documentation changes now
    ensure that the documentation accurately represents the required
    behaviour for the drivers.

    Build system: modernize support for our gd device driver

    This change updates the find module and how those results are used to
    support the gd device driver.  These changes should allow those who
    are still interested in this deprecated device to much more easily
    diagnose any trouble in finding the GD library or headers.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    using the -DDEFAULT_ALL_DEVICES=ON option both for when the
    GD library was not installed and when it was installed.  In the
    latter case, I also built the test_c_png, test_c_gif,
    and test_c_jpeg targets without any obvious (segfault, etc.) run
    time issues.

    Set default DPI to be used by our device drivers

    The PLPLOT_DEFAULT_DPI symbolic constant is #defined and initially
    used in the cgm, gd, and wxwidgets device drivers.  Use of the
    PLPLOT_DEFAULT_DPI default DPI in additional device drivers is
    requested if the choice is between some arbitrary default value for
    the device driver that has been used in the past and
    PLPLOT_DEFAULT_DPI.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    by building the cgm and wxwidgets devices.

    Fix problem with wxFont affecting Ubuntu withwxWidgets 3.0

    Creating a wxFont without a valid application in Ubuntu using wxWidgets
    3,0 causes a crash. To work around this I have created a Font class
    which encapsulates a wxFont and the plplot font metrics. This allows the
    Font to be created and compared to other Fonts for caching puposes, but
    the actual creation of a wxFont object is delayed until the wxFont is
    requested. We can check for a valid wxDC bbefore we do thisavoiding the
    problems.

    Improve comprehensive test script

    The improvements were the following

    (1) Collect values of any environment variable with PLPLOT somewhere
    in the name, such as PLPLOT_DRV_DIR.  In general such variables should not be set except
    as a very last resort and only if you know exactly what you are doing, but there
    is ancient advice that has been propagated to a lot of Windows users
    to always set these variables so be sure to collect any such deprecated
    settings if they exist since they generally screw up comprehensive
    testing.

    (2) Completely reorganize the order of tests.  The previous order was

    for shared, nondynamic, and static configurations do the following...

    ctest in build tree
    test_noninteractive in build tree
    test_noninteractive in installed examples tree
    traditional test_noninteractive in installed examples tree
    test_interactive in build tree
    test_interactive in installed examples tree
    traditional test_interactive in installed examples tree

    That order has now been revised to

    for shared, nondynamic, and static configurations do the following...
    test_interactive in build tree
    test_interactive in installed examples tree
    traditional test_interactive in installed examples tree

    for shared, nondynamic, and static configurations do the following...
    test_noninteractive in build tree
    ctest in build tree
    test_noninteractive in installed examples tree
    traditional test_noninteractive in installed examples tree

    Note that interactive results are kept in shared/interactive,
    nondynamic/interactive, and static/interactive directory trees and
    noninteractive and ctest results are kept in shared/noninteractive,
    nondynamic/noninteractive, and static/noninteractive directory trees.
    Therefore, there is no interference between the interactive and
    noninteractive cases.

    The large convenience advantage of the new order is it gets the interactive stuff (if
    any) completely done first for all configurations.  So all the user busy
    work dealing with interactive tests is done immediately and all at
    once rather than having to wait long times for noninteractive parts of
    the tests to complete before there is a temporary burst of
    interactivity.

    The other advantage of the new order is that ctest
    --extra-verbose output is problematic on some platforms (e.g., Cygwin) so you can get a
    ctest error with no extra verbose explanation of the cause.  The
    test_noninteractive results are essentially a superset of the ctest
    ones (although implemented quite differently with real dependencies)
    with no known issues with verbose output.  So the new order means you
    should always get verbose output from test_noninteractive if one
    of the non-interactive tests is failing.  And only if
    test_noninteractive succeeds in the build tree does the comprehensive test continue
    with ctest in the build tree.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_xwin=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_cxx=ON"

    to give a quick check of the reorganized script with both interactive
    and noninteractive components.  The script completed without issues,
    and the table of contents of the resulting report tarball seemed to be
    complete.

    Fix static variable bug in svg device

    The problem was due to using a static variable which_clip to keep track of
    clip id's.  This meant that
    group file results (as generated by e.g., the Octave examples) had
    different clip id numbers in the various files being generated
    compared to individual file results (as generated, e.g., by the C
    examples).  So using -DPLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE:STRING=svg generated
    differences for every example between the octave and other results.

    I fixed this bug by making which_clip part of the SVG struct (which
    automatically initializes that variable to 0 because the struct memory
    is calloced).  Here are the remaining ctest octave issues after this
    fix for -DPLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE:STRING=svg

    octave
      Missing examples            :  14a 31
      Differing graphical output  :
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    So this fix clearly makes the octave result much better, but is not
    the full story for the octave examples (which give clean results for
    the default psc device).

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    using the -DPLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE:string=svg cmake option and

    make -j4 all >& all.out
    ctest -j4 --extra-verbose --tests-regex '_c$|_cxx|_f95|_java|_octave|_python|_tcl|_ada|_ocaml|_lua|_d|_compare' >& ctest.out

    The regex expression is to save time by doing only do the subset of
    the ctests involving file comparisons of various bindings results with
    the svg device.

    This test gave clean results for all bindings other than octave (see
    above) and ada, adathick, and ocaml, i.e.,

    ada
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :
    adathick
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :
    ocaml
      Missing examples            :
      Differing graphical output  :  08 19 33
      Missing stdout              :
      Differing stdout            :

    These issues (which are similar to but not exactly the same as the
    equivalent test for the default -DPLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE:STRING=psc case)
    are due to the ada and ocaml bindings and examples not being kept up
    to speed with the bindings and examples for all other languages.

    Test system: improvements in the logic for setting up ctest

    TEST_DEVICE --> PLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE

    Preferred the "PLPLOT_" prefix on this important user-configurable
    string detailing what file device to use for bindings comparisons.

    Compacted the logic (and also dropped any maintenance burden) by using
    FILE_DEVICES_LIST to figure out what tests to generate for the C
    language.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux
    using the -DPLPLOT_TEST_DEVICE:string=svg cmake option and

    make -j4 all >& all.out
    ctest -j4 --tests-regex '_c$|_cxx|_f95|_java|_octave|_python|_tcl|_ada|_ocaml|_lua|_d|_compare' >& ctest.out

    The regex expression is to only do the subset of the ctests involving
    file comparisons of various bindings results with the svg device.

    The result showed severe file comparison problems for the Octave case
    which will be dealt with later, but no issues with the logic changes
    in how the ctest tests are configured.

    Traditional build system: fix linking to rt library

    For ENABLE_DYNDRIVERS=OFF case, wxwidgets device code is part of
    libplplot, and therefore that library must be linked to the rt
    library.  This linking issue has long since been solved for the CMake-based build
    system case, and what the current fix does is propagate that rt
    library linking fix to the configured pkg-config plplot.pc file and
    therefore to the traditional build of the installed examples as well.

    For some reason this linking issue for the traditional build has not
    caused any problems on Debian wheezy, but it is hoped this fix will
    solve a rt-related linking problem for the traditional build in the
    static case that comprehensive testing by Greg Jung on the openSUSE
    platform has turned up.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux using

    scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --cmake_added_options "-DDEFAULT_NO_DEVICES=ON -DPLD_wxwidgets=ON -DPLD_ps=ON -DDEFAULT_NO_BINDINGS=ON -DENABLE_wxwidgets=ON -DENABLE_cxx=ON" --do_test_interactive no

    which merely proves the fix does no harm in the Debian wheezy case.
    However, I also checked the pkg-config results now contain the -lrt
    link flag, and also that flag (as expected) is used for the
    traditional build of, e.g., the C examples so the fix is working as
    designed with the only question remaining concerning this fix being
    whether that design will completely fix the openSUSE issue.

    Build system: libcsironn: libplplot: implement choice between qhull/qhull_a.h and libqhull/qhull_a.h form of include for qhull headers

    Because libqhull uses common names for header files (e.g.,
    io.h which is also a standard Windows header) the #include must be of
    the form

    where <unique_name> solves the name clash between qhull headers and
    other headers.  The qhull documentation recommends "qhull" for the
    unique name, and most software distributions have adopted that, but
    some of them (e.g., Cygwin and openSUSE) use "libqhull" instead for
    the unique name.  So this commit implements an automatic choice between those
    two variants where both forms are looked for, and the one that is
    found is used for compilations of libcsironn and libplplot.

    Tested by: Alan W. Irwin <airwin@users.sourceforge.net> on Linux by
    building the csironn and plplot targets for the "qhull" case that is
    appropriate to my Debian Linux distro.  N.B. Tests of this change for
    distributions of software using the "libqhull" unique name convention
    also need to be done.
