This directory contains the source needed to compile plplot under djgpp,
the gcc for DOS and '386+ machines.  Please retreive djgpp from the
simtel20 archives and use their references for more info.

To compile everything simply:
1) mkmf
2) cd tmp
3) make links
4) make
5) mkdir \plplot
6) make install

To compile the demos:
7) cd \plplot\demos\c
8) make cdemos

To compile the f2c demos:
9) cd \plplot\demos\f77
10) make fdemos

The install can provide the stubs for FORTRAN via "f2c", the
fortran-to-C converter.  Set the "enable_f77" variable to "yes" in
./mkmf.bat install the f2c stubs.  Check netlib.att.com for the latest
source to f2c.

This will install the plplot library in /plplot/lib and the demos in
/plplot/demos.  This can be changed in the ./cf/init.in file.  (Please
note the UNIX and MS-DOS name types and change BOTH.)

Other customizations:

 o Define (string) values for LIB_DIR, BIN_DIR, and TCL_DIR in plconfig.h
   if you want plplot to look somewhere other than the hardwired or
   environmentally-set locations for the files it needs.

 o Define the appropriate macro in pldevs.h in order to enable the
   corresponding output driver.

This procedure was done with djgpp 1.11m5.  The new djgpp 1.12 was just 
released and I haven't downloaded it yet.
