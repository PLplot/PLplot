  <title>Using PLplot from Perl</title>
  <para>
    There are no proper bindings for the Perl language delivered with the
    PLplot sources.  However, a PLplot interface has been added to the Perl
    Data Language (PDL) since version 2.4.0.  If the PLplot library is
    installed in the system, it is automatically detected by the PDL
    configuration script, such that PLplot support for PDL should work out of
    the box.
