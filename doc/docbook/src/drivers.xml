  <title>The PLplot Display Driver Family</title>

  <para>
    Drivers that provide screen displays are described in this chapter.  
    Each of the drivers has a list of options, and these may be set as 
    outlined in <xref linkend="arguments" />.
  </para>


  <!-- ================================================================== -->
  <!-- XWIN -->

  <sect1 id="xwin-driver">
    <title>The Xwin Driver (X-Windows)</title>
    
    <para> 
      The Xwin driver draws plots in an X-window.  Although some of the
      newer features are not supported, it remains the reference driver
      for PLplot.
    </para>

    <para>
      Plots are displayed one page at a time.  The pager is advanced by 
      pressing the Enter key, and may only be advanced in the forward
      direction.
    </para> 

    <para>
      Anti-aliasing is not supported, and the Xwin driver is not 
      unicode-enabled.
    </para>

    <para>
      The available driver options are:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>

  <sect1 id="aqt-driver">
    <title>The AquaTerm Driver (Mac OS X)</title>
    
    <para> 
      The AquaTerm driver is a Mac OS X specific driver that is used with 
      the AquaTerm Graphics Terminal. It is unicode enabled. Text, lines
      and shades are anti-aliased.
    </para>
    
    <para>

  <!-- wxWidgets -->

  <sect1 id="wxWidgets-driver">
    <title>The wxWidgets Driver (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)</title>

    <para>
      The basic wxWidgets driver's features and user interface are described 
      in the section called 'Driver Basics'. The file 
      drivers/README.wxwidgets describes how you can use the PLplot library 
      within your wxWidgets application.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="wxWidgets-driver-basics">
      <title>wxWidgets Driver Basics</title>

      <para>
	The wxWidgets driver plots in a Frame provided by the wxWidgets 
	library. The driver is quite complete but lacks many of the GUI 
	features of the TK driver. All plots are available at once 
	an one can switch between all plots by pressing Alt-n. The 
	application can be quit with Alt-x. These functions are also 
	available in the menu. After the last plot one will advance again 
	to the first plot. Anti-aliasing is supported and and the wxWidgets 
	driver is unicode enabled. It is also possible to address the 
	wxWidgets driver from within a wxWidgets application - this is 
	described in the next section.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	The available driver options (used with the
	<parameter>-drvopt</parameter> command-line argument) are:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
	    text: Use TrueType fonts (0|1); default 1
	  </para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>
	    smooth: switch on/off anti-aliasing (0|1); default 1
	  </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The text option toggles between TrueType and Hershey fonts. The 
	Hershey fonts provide a reference implementation for text 
	representation in PLplot.
      </para>

      <para>
	The smooth option will turn on or off text smoothing for True 
	Type fonts. This will increase the time for a plot considerably.

  <!-- PDF -->

  <sect1 id="pdf-driver">
    <title>The PDF Driver</title>
    
    <para>
      A basic version of a pdf driver has been added to PLplot. This driver 
      is based on the libharu library see:
      <ulink url="http://libharu.sourceforge.net/">
	http://libharu.sourceforge.net/</ulink>.
	At present only the Hershey fonts are used and there is no support for 
	pdf or ttf fonts. Compression of the pdf output is not enabled and the 
	paper size can't be chosen. All these issues will be addressed in 
	later releases.

  <!-- PS -->

  <sect1 id="postscript-driver">
    <title>The PostScript Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      The PostScript driver produces publication-quality PostScript
      output.  The driver provides two devices: the ps device for 
      black-and-white plots, and the psc device for color plots.
    </para>

    <para>
      This driver is unicode enabled, and PostScript Type I fonts are used.
      Type I fonts do not have all of the available unicode symbols
      represented.  For this reason, Hershey fonts are used for drawing 
      symbols by default, unless specified otherwise using the driver options.
    </para>

    <para>
      The available driver options are:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	  text: Use PostScript text (0|1); default 1
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	  color: Use color (0|1); default 1

  <!-- ================================================================== -->
  <!-- PS-TTF -->

  <sect1 id="truetype-postscript-driver">
    <title>The TrueType PostScript Driver</title>
    
    <para>
      This is a PostScript driver that supports TrueType fonts. This 
      allows access to a far greater range of fonts and characters than 
      is possible using Type 1 PostScript fonts 
      (see <xref linkend="postscript-driver"/>).
      It is the driver to use for generating publication quality output
      using PLplot. The driver provides two devices: the ps-ttf device
      for black-and-white plots and the ps-ttfc device for color plots.
    </para>

    <para>
      The driver requires the LASi (v1.0.5), pango and pangoft2 libraries 
      to work. The pango and pangoft2 libraries are widely distributed 
      with most Linux distributions and give the psttf driver full complex 
      text layout (CTL) capability (see 
      <ulink url="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php">
      http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples/demo24.php</ulink>
      for an example of this capability).  The LASi library is not part of 
      most distributions at this time. The source code can be downloaded 
      from http://www.unifont.org/lasi/. The library is small and easy to 
      build and install.  Make sure you use LASi-1.0.5.  The psttf device 
      driver uses new capabilities in this version of LASi and no longer 
      works with LASi-1.0.4.
    </para>

    <para>
      The available driver options are:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	  text: Use TrueType fonts for text (0|1); default 1
	</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>

  <!-- PS-TeX -->

  <sect1 id="latex-postscript-driver">
    <title>The LaTeX PostScript Driver</title>
    
    <para> 
      This is a PostScript device driver that writes out its results in two
      files.  (1) The encapsulated postscript (EPS) file contains all the
      postscript commands for rendering the plot without characters, and (2)
      the LaTeX file contains a fragment of LaTeX that reads in the EPS file
      and renders the plot characters using LaTeX commands (and LaTeX
      fonts!) in alignment with the EPS file to produce a combined result.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      
      Suppose you create the EPS and LaTeX files with the following command:
      <userinput>./x01c -dev pstex -o x01c.eps</userinput>.  The EPS file
      is then stored in <filename>x01c.eps</filename> and the LaTeX fragment
      is stored in <filename>x01c.eps_t</filename>.  Then
      you may use the generated files with the <filename>x01c.tex</filename>
      LaTeX code that follows:
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <programlisting>\documentclass{article}
      \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
      \begin{document}
      \input{x01c.eps_t}
      \end{document}
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      and generate PostScript results using the LaTeX fonts with the following
      command: <userinput>latex x01c.tex; dvips -f &lt;x01c.dvi &gt;x01c.ps
      </userinput>.  The results look good (aside from an obvious bounding-box
      problem that still needs to be fixed with this device) and should be
      useful for LaTeX enthusiasts.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are no available driver options.
    </para>

  </sect1>


  <!-- ================================================================== -->
  <!-- SVG -->

  <sect1 id="svg-driver">
    <title>The SVG Driver</title>

    <para>
      The SVG driver produces Scalable Vector Graphics files that are 
      compliant with the SVG 1.1 specification as defined here:
      http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/. The driver is unicode enabled
      and both text and lines are anti-aliased. As SVG is just an
      XML based graphics language, the visual quality of the resulting 
      plot will depend on the SVG rendering engine that is used and
      what fonts that are available to it.
