Intro
-----

The [OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr) bindings for PLplot provide three means of accessing PLplot's functionality through three modules, Plplot, Plplot.Plot and Plplot.Quick_plot. In versions 5.9.6 and later the OCaml sections of the [PLplot documentation](http://plplot.sourceforge.net/documentation.php) includes a tutorial which introduces each of these modules. This tutorial is meant to expand on that material and allow for a simpler process for contributing improvements.

Using the Quick_plot module
----------------------------

The main OCaml PLplot module is meant to be open'd:

` open Plplot`

From here, one can try out a quick plot of sin and cos:

` Quick_plot.func [sin; cos] (-3.14, 3.14)`

which gives output which looks something like this:

That's great, but it would be even better if there were labels so that we know what the axes mean and a legend to show which line corresponds with which function. We can do that:

` Quick_plot.func`
`   ~labels:("Angle (radians)", "f(x)", "A few functions")`
`   ~names:["sin"; "cos"]`
`   [sin; cos] (-3.15, 3.15)`

with output which looks something like this:

[[img src=Quick_plot_labels.png alt=Quick_plot_labels.png]]


Much better, and much easier to interpret!
