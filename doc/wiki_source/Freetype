Description
-----------

FreeType 2 is a software font engine that is designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images). It can be used in graphics libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text image generation tools, and many other products as well. <http://www.freetype.org> reveals more information.

Instructions for Mac OS X
-------------------------

PLplot uses either fonts provided by the Free UCS Outline Fonts project (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/) or Windows fonts (Arial, etc.). Both are not installed on Mac OS X by default. You can download the FreeFonts from <http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freefont/> and copy the ttf files into the User's Library/Fonts directory. In order cmake can find these fonts, we need to set the PL_FREETYPE_FONT_PATH option, e.g.

`cmake -DPL_FREETYPE_FONT_PATH=/Users/smekal/Library/Fonts/ ..`

### Macports

freetype is also available via Macports. To install the freetype library open the terminal and enter

`sudo port install freetype`

Instructions for Windows
------------------------

-   Download the [Freetype library](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/ft237.zip)
-   Unzip the ft237.zip package in a suitable place
-   Cd into the new directory

### MinGW compiler

-   Then for MinGW (call <tt>mingw32.make</tt> twice!):

`mingw32-make`
`mingw32-make`
`copy objs\freetype.a objs\libfreetype.a`

### Visual C++ compiler

-   Or for Visual C++ (you need to use GNU-Make not nmake - download it from <http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw32-make-3.80.0-3.tar.gz?download> or <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm>):

`path_to_gnu_make\mingw32-make setup visualc`
`path_to_gnu_make\mingw32-make`

-   For Visual C++ 2005 you need to change line 69 of <tt>freetype-2.2.1\\builds\\compiler\\visualc.mk</tt> to

`   CFLAGS ?= /nologo /c /Ox /W3 /WX /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE`

### Set CMake paths

-   set environment variables (for MinGW and Visual C++)

`set FREETYPEDIR=C:\freetype-2.2.1`
`set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=%FREETYPEDIR%\include`
`set CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=%FREETYPEDIR%\objs`

CMake is now able to find the freetype library and headers.
