Description
-----------

[gd](http://www.libgd.org) is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or JPEG file. This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.

*Note:* This driver has been deprecated in favour of more modern library like libcairo and libpango. See the relevant Wiki pages for these.
