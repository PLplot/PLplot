Unpack the latest tarball ([download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot/files/plplot/)) which creates a tree with e.g. the top-level directory plplot-5.10.0

`cp -a plplot-5.10.0 plplot-5.10.0new`

Make your changes in the correct location in plplot-5.10.0new overwriting some of the files and adding new files in some cases. You should not compile anything in either plplot-5.10.0 or plplot-5.10.0new. That is, both should be clean directory trees. In order to test your changes make sure you configure plplot with CMake out-of-source. E.g.

`cd plplot-5.10.0new`
`mkdir build`
`cd build`
`cmake ..`
`make`

If you have made changes to the PLplot documentation, you should also check the validity of the documentation syntax:

`make validate`

This documentation validation does not require performing a full build of the PLplot documentation. Note that running the validation requires the "onsgmls" program to be present.

Remove the build directory after you tested your changes.

`cd ..`
`rm -rf build`
`cd ..`

To produce the patch from the two clean directory trees (don't forget to remove the CMake build directory) set up above do the following:

`diff -Naur plplot-5.10.0 plplot-5.10.0new >plplot-5.10.0.patch`

Please review plplot-5.10.0.patch to make sure those are the exact changes to the main tree that you require and nothing extra. Afterwards do the following:

`gzip plplot-5.10.0.patch`

Send plplot-5.10.0.patch.gz (the file created by gzip) to the the [plplot-devel list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/plplot-devel).
