The official PLplot wiki home page is located at
<https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Home/>.

As of 2014-10-05 (see mailing-list post with subject line "I have
completed moving our Wiki to SourceForge" for all the details) pandoc
(to convert from mediawiki format to markdown), sed scripts, and some
hand editing were used to propagate our old wiki (at
<http://www.miscdebris.net/plplot_wiki/> to the above SF site.  At
that time date tags were applied to all our SF wiki pages to indicate
when they had last been updated.  Since that propagation quite a few
of those SF wiki pages have been further updated (along with their
date tags) using the SF GUI editor for wiki pages.

But I have now (2018-11-01) decided that instead of relying on that
GUI editor it is a much better procedure to put the Markdown source
for all those ~50 wiki pages under git control in this directory.  Accordingly
I have copied the Markdown source of all our SF wiki pages here (using ctrl-c
in a SF GUI editor selection for a selection of the entire page there, and paste within
a file edit session to copy that text to a file in this directory.

So from now on to update a wiki page follow the steps in the "Updating
our wiki pages" section of README.developers in the top directory of
the PLplot source tree.  The advantages of this method are it gives us
version control of wiki pages, it gives us an automatic backup of our
wiki pages, and it allows our developers to use their favorite editor
to update the wiki.
