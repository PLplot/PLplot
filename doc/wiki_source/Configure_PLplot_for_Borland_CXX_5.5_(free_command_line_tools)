You need a working Borland C++ 5.5 free command line tool installation. Start the command line interface and issue the following commands:

`cd plplot`
`mkdir buildbcc`
`cd buildbcc`
`cmake -G "Borland Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install ..`
`make`
`make install`

This will build a shared plplot library and install all files into the directory <tt>plplot\\buildbcc\\install</tt>. The following options are available for cmake:

-   <tt>-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF</tt>: static build of plplot
-   <tt>-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON</tt>: makefiles provide verbose informations
-   <tt>-DBUILD_TEST=ON</tt>: all examples will be built also (for test purposes)
-   [Configuration of wxWidgets driver](Configuration_of_wxWidgets_driver "wikilink")

If you used the <tt>-DBUILD_TEST=ON</tt> option, you need to copy some files in order to run the examples:

`cd examples\c`
`copy ..\..\..\data\*.fnt .`

and additionally some dlls for a shared plplot built:

`copy ..\..\src\libplplotd.dll .`
`copy "..\..\bindings\c++\libplplotcxxd.dll" . (for c++ examples)`
`copy ..\..\lib\csa\libcsirocsa.dll . (if library as built)`

and for the wxWidgets driver (if wxWidgets library is shared):

`copy %WXWIN%\lib\gcc_dll\wxmsw26d_bcc_custom.dll .`

if this dll is not in the path.
