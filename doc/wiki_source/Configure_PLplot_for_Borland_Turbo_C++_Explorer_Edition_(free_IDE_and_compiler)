Everything is pretty much as with Borland C++ 5.5, the only thing that's needs change are lines in the top-level CMakeLists.txt.

Comment this out (near line 159):

`# Borland Compiler must compile in ANSII mode`
`if(BORLAND)`
`  ADD_DEFINITIONS(-A)`
`endif(BORLAND)`

I.e. lines above should look like:

`# Borland Compiler must compile in ANSII mode`
`#if(BORLAND)`
`#  ADD_DEFINITIONS(-A)`
`#endif(BORLAND)`

The reason for this is, that '-A' flag forces ASCII compile mode, which results in compiler errors when processing winnt.h (it uses some Borland special extensions like '_EDX' register names) and winreg.h. Also it fails on some source .c files because of single-line comments starting with '//'.

I understand that commenting out something in CMakeLists.txt is hack-like thing, but this option cannot be configured usual way, because the commented lines add '-A' to compiler command line after all other flags have been added, so putting '-AT' or '-A-' in CMAKE_C_FLAGS doesn't help.
