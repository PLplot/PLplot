(1) This used to work but does not currently. Work is in progress to bring Octave back to a working state.

(2) This should work if you can get LASi and all of its dependencies installed correctly. A package manager such as Fink is probably the best way to go.

(3) Both Fortran bindings, f77 and f95, don't work on Mac OS X 10.5.

(4) Test on Mac OS X 10.5.1 (where wxWidgets 2.8.4 is preinstalled).

(5) One user had difficulties with version 4.2.1 (error messages from libtool) and succeeded with version 4.3 (from MacResearch). As version 4.2.1 is rather old, we recommend this newer version.
