Some versions of ifort may need additional command line options to ensure all examples work correctly. To set options for the fortran compiler you need to set the FC environment variable before running cmake. The syntax depends on which shell you are using, e.g.

export FC="ifort --assume byterecl" (bash / sh)

setenv FC "ifort --assume byterecl" (csh / tcsh)

### Useful command line options

--assume byterecl
:   Assume fortran records are 1 byte long when reading in unformatted files. The default for ifort is 4 bytes (as for v8.1) however example 20 currently assumes 1 byte records. This option will ensure example 20 works correctly. It is not necessary for building the core plplot library and fortran bindings.
