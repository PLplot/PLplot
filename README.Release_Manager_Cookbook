N.B. the order of steps below is important because of the dependencies
between the steps which are noted (except for the generation of the
final release tarball and ChangeLog which depend on virtually all
prior steps).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update versions

This step depends on no others.

Update PLplot version in www/examples.php.  Also follow the
instructions in cmake/modules/plplot_version.cmake to update all
version information.

Also

export plplot_version=5.12.0
export old_plplot_version=5.11.1

for further use in this file (much of it for real on the command line, but
some of it symbolic for what you do using GUI's).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare a (preliminary) version of the ChangeLog file for this release

This step does not depend on other steps.

Confirm previous release tag.

git tag --list |grep '^plplot-${old_plplot_version}'

Checkout an up-to-date master branch or a topic branch that is rebased on
up-to-date master, then create the preliminary ChangeLog from that.

git checkout master
git log --name-status --reverse <tag-name>..HEAD >| /tmp/ChangeLog.release_preliminary

where <tag-name> is the tag-name for the tag corresponding to the
last release.

Also, create a summary of all the commits topics for quick reference.
git log --oneline --reverse <tag-name>..HEAD >| /tmp/ChangeLog.release_preliminary_summary

Note because of the --reverse option above the order of these logs will
be in chronological order.  But it is traditional for the final
version ChangeLog to have the result in default reverse
chronological order so the --reverse option is not used in that case
(see below).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare and test the documentation

This step depends on the "Update versions" step above.

Update the doxygen documentation (in our source code) and DocBook
documentation (in doc/docbook/src) to reflect any changes (new drivers
or new PLplot functionality) in the current release cycle.  Or
encourage those who made the changes to update the
documentation.  Generate and test our doxygen form of documentation
following the instructions in doc/README.doxygen.

Update doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt to reflect your best estimate
of the (UTC) release date that will be used in the documentation build.

Update, generate and test our Docbook documentation following the
instructions in doc/docbook/README.developers.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Check and potentially fix internal consistency

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Prepare and test the documentation".

Some of the files in the source tree are generated from other files
in the source tree using build-system targets.  All targets that
have "check" in the name prefix are these kind of targets.  Also,
some of the checks require special setup or take too long for the
general case, and these will be configured only for the
-DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON case.

So use the above cmake option, and then for a complete list of
checks run

make help |grep '... check' |sort

in the build tree.  The current result of that command should be

... check_all
... check_api_xml_consistency
... check_f95_parameters
... check_ifort_definitions_file
... check_libtclmatrix_capabilities
... check_plplot_h.inc
... check_plplotcapi_defines
... check_swig_documentation
... check_tcl_parameters


check_api_xml_consistency and check_plplot_h.inc currently (5.12.0) fail so
have been excluded from the dependencies of check_all.

Note the check_api_xml_consistency checker only exists if
-DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON and our build system finds the
golang application api.xml_consistency_checker.  For more details
concerning how to install that application see the Appendix section
entitled "The golang API consistency checker".  Currently (5.12.0),
that checker finds two inconsistencies which are:

c_plshade1 is not documented.
para 0 of func plGetCursor type mismatch [ PLGraphicsIn * ] vs. [
struct PLGraphicsIn * ]

The first inconsistency is expected (plshade1 is C only so it
is not part of the common API, and will likely be deprecated
soon in any case).  The solution here is probably to drop
all references to c_plshade1.

The second api_xml inconsistency has no immediately obvious cause
so needs further study.

The plplot_h.inc inconsistency from bindings/ocaml has no immediately obvious cause
so needs further study.

Note the check_plplot_h.inc target only exists
because -DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON implies
-DGENERATE_PLPLOT_H_INC=ON by default which in turn requires
that at least the OCaml version of the Perl regular expression library
be installed.  (On Debian the associated package name is
libpcre-ocaml-dev.)  Normally, GENERATE_PLPLOT_H_INC is OFF by default
to reduce build dependencies.

To actually do the internal consistency checks, run each of the above
targets by running the check_all target.  Each individual check target
typically generates a file in the build tree which is
then compared (using the Unix cmp command) with the file that is being
checked in the source tree.  If the two files are inconsistent (which
can be caused by documentation updates, for example), the cmp command
complains, and you should follow up by doing a diff between the two
files to confirm that the changes are reasonable followed by copying
the build-tree version of the file on top of the source-tree version
and committing the source-tree version.  When this process is completed,
all the above targets should run with no cmp or other errors/warnings
at all, e.g.,

software@raven> make check_all

should just work without errors.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare the README.release file and/or encourage those who have made
   changes in this release cycle to update that file

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Prepare a (preliminary) version of the ChangeLog file for this release".

To double-check that file is complete with regards to all major
developments during this release cycle, skim all the commit messages in
ChangeLog.release_preliminary determined above.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update website-related files

This step does not depend on other steps.

Use "git diff" and "git log" on the examples directory (or some
subdirectory of that such as examples/lua which normally has little
activity unless some real changes to the standard examples have been
made) with appropriate commit id limits to discover whether there is a
necessity to update the examples list in
scripts/htdocs-gen_plot-examples.sh. And if so, do that update.  That
list is used to generate the website example-related files and copy
the results to the website. The list automatically controls what
example source code is configured (for source code that needs that),
as well as what example plots and example thumbnails are generated.
The list also automatically controls what examples-related files are
copied to the website.

Update the project web page including the examples.  For example, edit
www/examples.php to reflect any changes to the examples themselves
(i.e. pages added or removed from an existing example or entirely new
examples).

Note, the xmlto package that must be installed in order to generate
the DocBook documentation (see doc/docbook/README.developers referred
to above) is also used to generate some of our older release
announcements for the website, and could also be used to generate
present release announcements for the website if desired.  See
www/announce/README for just how easy this step would be.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Install and test a (preliminary) local copy of the PLplot website

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Prepare and test the documentation" and
"Update website-related files"

Also you should use your best estimate of the UTC release_date
which is configured as RELEASE_DATE in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt.
That value will likely require modification to generate the final
website result below.

N.B. The git checkout-index command exports everything from the
working directory that is in the index or committed, but it will
ignore local changes in the working directory that haven't been
"added".  So use "git add" or "git commit" judiciously before running
this script to get all local changes relevant to website generation
tested by this script.

To build the local form of the website (including both the doxygen and
DocBook forms of our documentation) run (on a Linux host that is
capable of building the documentation for the source tree that has all
local changes)

scripts/generate_website.sh

with no arguments (but with stdin configured as below using echo).
The script asks you four questions, gives you a chance to verify your
answers, then does all the rest of it (downloading a throwaway copy of
the PLplot source code, building the doxygen and DocBook
documentation, generating the announcements that are part of the base
website, uploading the base website, uploading the documentation,
building the examples, running the examples, uploading the example
source code and example results) automatically.  I (AWI) ran this
script as follows:

echo irwin$'\n'irwin$'\n'raven$'\n'/home/irwin/public_html/plplot$'\n'yes |scripts/generate_website.sh

==>

Summary:
USERNAME = irwin
GROUPNAME = irwin
HOSTNAME = raven
WEBSITE_PREFIX = /home/irwin/public_html/plplot

(raven is my local computer name, and /home/irwin/public_html is a location
where I can store various websites).  The above command took ~3 minutes to run
on my computer.

You can check for warnings by

find /tmp/plplotdoc -name '*.out' |xargs grep -i warning |less

This turned up quite a few warnings including 3 from doxygen,
but all of these warnings seemed ignorable.

You can check for errors (e.g., due
to missing commands that need to be installed) by running

find /tmp/plplotdoc -name '*.out' |xargs grep -i error |grep -vE 'unable to read file loc from|Generating call.*graph for function'

(Those grep -vE stanzas are to remove output lines from doxygen that tend to
include some case variants of "error" in the string because the
referred to function name contains that substring.)

The above location translates to the following URL
<http://raven/~irwin/plplot/htdocs>, and I test that URL by clicking on most links,
checking the documentation looks good, checking the examples are
complete and look good and the source code for each language for
examples is accessible, etc.  Some iterations with the
steps above entitled

"Prepare and test the documentation" and
"Update website-related files"

will likely be required.

N.B. As explained above scripts/generate_website.sh uses the index of
the git working directory (but ignores local changes which have not
yet been added to the index) as the source tree for generating the
local website.  So there is no need to commit every documentation,
example, and version change until you are completely satisfied with
the local website.  But after you _are_ satisfied with the local
website you should commit all your changes so they are available for
generating the tarball and ChangeLog (see below) for this release.

N.B. The iterated result should be identical to the final result (see
below) except for correcting (if necessary) the RELEASE_DATE as mentioned
above.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update this file (README.Release_Manager_CookBook)

Edit this file to reflect latest practices by the release manager and
also to update the many version numbers in it to the latest version
value.

_________________________________________________________________________

** Create (a preliminary version of) the release tarball and check the
   result for errors

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Prepare and test documentation"
"Check and potentially fix internal consistency"

The -c option runs ctest on the directory tree unpacked from the
release tarball, and the -i option installs a build from that
directory tree.  N.B. be careful what you specify for the
-i option since that directory will be completely removed
initially.

scripts/make_tarball.sh -c -i /tmp/plplot_install

This script takes ~10 minutes to complete on my computer.

Check for warnings.

find /tmp/plplot-dist-prep -name "*.out" |xargs grep -i warning |less

Those appear to be fairly numerous, but in all cases expected
such as known cmake warnings, known doxygen warnings due to its
poor code parsing ability, etc.

find /tmp/plplot-dist-prep -name "*.out" |xargs grep -i error |less

This search found some hits, but all seem to be innocuous except possibly
for the following doxygen error

/tmp/plplot-dist-prep/build_dir/make_prebuild_dist.out:error: NamespaceDef::insertMembers(): member `_swig_property' with class scope `' inserted in namespace scope `plplotc'!
/tmp/plplot-dist-prep/build_dir/make_prebuild_dist.out:error: NamespaceDef::insertMembers(): member `_swig_property' with class scope `' inserted in namespace scope `plplotc_fixed'!

(I count this as one error because those two python files are duplicates of each other.)
However, I can find no issues with the doxygen-produced documentation of plplotc.py (and
plplotc_fixed.py).  So I attribute this error to some issue with doxygen parsing
of python.

Look at the ctest results:

less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/ctest_build_dir/ctest.out
less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/ctest_build_dir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

Browse the following install locations that were generated from the
tarball:

/tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/html/index.html
/tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/doxygen/html/index.html

/tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/plplot-$plplot_version.pdf

Look at tarball contents to make sure included filenames are
what is intended.

less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz

Also compare the table of contents of that tarball for the previous release with the present release.

tar ztf ../export/plplot-$old_plplot_version.tar.gz |sort >| /tmp/${old_plplot_version}.out
tar ztf /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz |sed -e "s?${plplot_version}?${old_plplot_version}?g" |sort >| /tmp/${plplot_version}.out
diff -au /tmp/${old_plplot_version}.out /tmp/${plplot_version}.out

Look at a few man pages that were generated from the tarball, e.g.,

man -M/tmp/plplot_install/share/man pllegend
man -M/tmp/plplot_install/share/man plsurf3dl

Look at the info pages that were generated from the tarball using

info /tmp/plplot_install/share/info/plplotdoc.info

Look at the ctest results


_________________________________________________________________________

** Do comprehensive test of PLplot

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Check and potentially fix internal consistency"
"Update date/versions"

Do a comprehensive test of the interactive and noninteractive
results.

scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --do_ctest no --do_test_noninteractive no
find ../comprehensive_test_disposeable -name "*.out" |grep -v a.out |xargs grep -i error
scripts/comprehensive_test.sh  --do_test_interactive no
find ../comprehensive_test_disposeable -name "*.out" |grep -v a.out |xargs grep -i error

Alternatively, on platforms (such as MinGW/MSYS) with
limited system libraries or platforms (such as CentOS) with system libraries which are too old for
PLplot's needs you can also do comprehensive testing using epa_build
(see cmake/epa_build/README for details).

Enter results of these and all other tests at
<https://sourceforge.net/p/plplot/wiki/Testing_PLplot/#Testing%20Reports>
(which is referred to by README.release).
_________________________________________________________________________

Install and test a local copy of the PLplot website

This step depends on the step above entitled
"Install and test a
(preliminary) local copy of the PLplot website"

Follow the exact instructions given in that step except this time correct
RELEASE_DATE (configured in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.text) if
necessary.  Here is the command I used for this step

echo irwin$'\n'irwin$'\n'raven$'\n'/home/irwin/public_html/plplot$'\n'yes | scripts/generate_website.sh
_________________________________________________________________________

Upload the local website to SourceForge

Once you are satisfied with the local website, you should upload it to
SourceForge with rsync.

For the above WEBSITE_PREFIX, here is what worked for me from my computer
with the hostname of raven where that WEBSITE_PREFIX directory was
created.

rsync -av --delete --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX \
/home/irwin/public_html/plplot/htdocs/ \
airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

Adjust for your username and WEBSITE_PREFIX.  The ",plplot" part of the
username makes sure you have the right group permissions and default website
directory location for PLplot.

The --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX options were introduced recently and
are recommended by the rsync man page to preserve SourceForge's file
and directory attributes.  It is only with those options that I am
able to get a clean result for a second rsync run.  (Otherwise, each
directory is mentioned as being changed.)  These options may solve the
website permissions problem mentioned in an Appendix.

N.B. the trailing slash on the source directory is essential and means rsync
the contents of this directory with the contents of the destination htdocs
directory.  Without the trailing slash you would rsync the the contents of
the source directory with the contents of the htdocs/htdocs destination
directory which is not what you want to do.

N.B. the --dry-run option for rsync is a godsend since it tells you exactly what
will happen without actually doing it.

Once you have a proper upload of the local website to SourceForge, test
it as before.  Also, click the xhtml and css validate buttons on each of
index.php, download.php, examples.php, documentation.php, and credits.php
to validate those pages.

_________________________________________________________________________

** Create ChangeLog.release and update ChangeLog.cumulated_release

N.B. commit all local changes to the repository so they will be
reflected in the ChangeLog, tagged version of the release, and the
release tarball.  And if there are committed changes after this one
repeat this step so the ChangeLog.release commit is the last commit on
master for this release cycle (with the possible exception of the
current file, README.Release_Manager_Cookbook).

Prepare the ChangeLog.release file to keep track of all changes
made for the release.  Make sure master and maint are up to date using

git fetch
git log --oneline -1 origin/master
git log --oneline -1 master
git log --oneline -1 maint

Create final ChangeLog for this release

# maint is a private topic branch I use for maintenance which I keep
# identical to master (confirmed with above git log command) before I
# start using it.
git checkout maint
git log --name-status <commit_id>..master >| ChangeLog.release

where <commit_id> is the last commit id of the log of commits for the
previous release cycle (i.e., plplot-$old_plplot_version for the $plplot_version release).  Note
this result (unlike the prelimary version above) will be in the
traditional reverse chronological order.

Preserve the historical record of the significant changes between versions of PLplot in one file by
prepending README.release for $plplot_version to README.cumulated_release

cat README.release README.cumulated_release > README.cumulated_release_new
mv README.cumulated_release_new README.cumulated_release

# Commit, fast-forward merge to master, and push

git add ChangeLog.release
git commit
# There is a chicken/egg situation here since the ChangeLog.release file
# does not include the log of its own last commit.  You could address
# that issue by re-running the above commit command, and amending the commit.
# However, that amending will change the commit id so the ChangeLog.release
# will have incorrect information about its own commmit id.
# So the best course is not to do such amending and accept that the
# ChangeLog.release file will not include the log of the last commit (i.e., its own commit)
# for the release.

git checkout master
#Last check there is nothing to download from server.
git fetch
# Only if git fetch did not download anything....
git merge --ff-only maint
git push origin master

The above command destroys the ChangeLog.release file
from the previous release and the associated commit on
master (and origin/master) should be the last commit of
this release.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Create the PLplot Release

   ++ Preliminaries

The preliminaries are very simple with git.  Stay on master and
change nothing there for the following tests of this release.


   ++ Create a final release tarball and check the result for errors

Follow the above step entitled

"Create (a preliminary version of) the release tarball and check the result for errors"

but this time for the current last commit of master (which includes
the latest ChangeLog.release) to make sure the
tarball is exactly consistent with the release tag that will be
created for that commit (if all is well).


   ++ Tag the release

Assuming all is well with the release tarball tests, then tag (with
signed key) HEAD of master and push it.

git checkout master

A list of your GPG keys can be obtained using, e.g.,

software@raven> gpg --list-keys Alan
pub   2048R/BB159E92 2011-08-19 [expires: 2021-12-12]
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (libLASi key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (FreeEOS key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (PLplot key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

The BB159E92 field above is the key one.

git tag --local-user=BB159E92 --message="PLplot ${plplot_version} release" plplot-${plplot_version}
# Note, a tag simply tags a particular commit so if I checkout some
# other branch (such as maint) that has the same tagged commit as
# as master, then the "git tag --list" command will find the tag
# (which I proved was actually true for maint).

# Verify signature (which also confirms the above tag message)

git tag --verify plplot-${plplot_version}

# Irrevocable step since no pushed tags can ever be deleted from
# upstream repository.
git push origin plplot-${plplot_version}

(Note we are changing release tag names here from the old scheme
which would have been v5_11_0 to a more informative scheme for names.)

   ++ Sign the release with your plplot Release Manager gpg key


gpg --default-key BB159E92 --detach-sign --armor /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz

where BB159E92 refers to the public key for Alan W. Irwin as taken from the above key list.

   ++ Verify the release tarball signing

gpg --verify /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

   ++ Make a SourceForge file release

#IMPORTANT
cd /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/

sftp airwin,plplot@frs.sourceforge.net <<EOF
cd /home/frs/project/p/pl/plplot/plplot
mkdir ${plplot_version}\ Source
cd ${plplot_version}\ Source
put plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc
put plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz
exit
EOF

# Save a local copy of the release tarball for future reference and
# also check it.
cd /home/software/plplot/HEAD/export #(or wherever)
cp -a /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz* .
gpg --verify plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

# Check and verify download from SF works:
cd /tmp
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/plplot/plplot/${plplot_version}%20Source/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/plplot/plplot/${plplot_version}%20Source/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz
gpg --verify plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

Prepare concatenated release notes + Changelog.

cd /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version
echo "

DETAILED CHANGELOG FOR THIS RELEASE

" | cat README.release - ChangeLog.release >| /tmp/README.release

cd /tmp
sftp airwin,plplot@frs.sourceforge.net <<EOF
cd /home/frs/project/p/pl/plplot/plplot/${plplot_version}\ Source
put /tmp/README.release
exit
EOF

Make, e.g., plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz, the "latest" version.

login to SF website with firefox
files ==> plplot ==> ${plplot_version} Source ==> view details (the "i" icon) for
plplot-${plplot_version}.tar.gz and hit the "select all" button and "save" button

It finishes with a "file properties updated" message, and appears to "take"
immediately.

Note also, the above does not work with konqueror because enabling ".sourceforge.net" under
javascript does not appear to cover all the javascript stuff that the sourceforge site users.
(firefox accepts javascript from any source so does not have this problem, but is insecure
as a result).

   ++ Make a SourceForge news item concerning this release

Create a news item for this release largely following previous
news items (or even identical to them but with a changed title).

Point your browser to http://sf.net/projects/plplot and login.  A
news item will then be available on the menu bar.  Click that, then
"new post".

Enter the title (e.g., PLplot Release $plplot_version) and the text.
The text is in markdown format so copying and pasting from a previous
news item (using the ctrl-c command on the editing area of the old
release notes to copy and ctrl-v command on the new release notes
editing area since normal cutting and pasting no longer works) is a
very efficient way to create the new news item.  After that copy and
paste, remember to change all occurrences of $old_plplot_version to
$plplot_version within the text, and also to update the highlights
area (by copying from the list of "2. Improvements relative to the previous release)
in README.release and changing all the numbers to "*").

   ++ Publicize the release announcement

Jerry: macresearch.org

Barbara Irwin: linuxtoday.com, lwn.net, lxer.com

   ++ Prepare immediately for the next release cycle

  a. Commit last-minute tweaks (e.g., in README.Release_Manager_Cookbook)
     that did not make it into the official tarball of the release or
     official tag of the release.

  b. Update README.release file to reflect the start of a new release
     cycle.

--- Appendix ---
_________________________________________________________________________

** The golang API consistency checker

The instructions for installing this golang application
are taken from doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt.

To build Hǎiliàng Wang's "check" application (which is written in the Go language)
follow these simple directions (which worked fine on 2017-01-27):

# Install golang AND gccxml packages from Debian Jessie (other distros
# may use different package names from these).

cd /home/software/golang_apps #(or wherever you like)
export GOPATH=$(pwd)
go get -u h12.me/go-plplot/c/check
go build h12.me/go-plplot/c/check

# The above creates the "check" executable in $GOPATH/bin
# That is too generic a name so symlink a more individual name
cd $GOPATH/bin; ln -s check api.xml_consistency_checker;

# Now put $GOPATH/bin on your PATH and CMake should do the rest
# by finding the api.xml_consistency_checker application on your
# PATH and running that appropriately when you build the
# check_api_xml_consistency target (see above).
_________________________________________________________________________

** GNU Privacy Guard (gpg)
A brief summary of developer relevant gpg commands, see also:
http://dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html,
man gpg, and http://www.gnupg.org/faq/GnuPG-FAQ.html.

   ++ Configure key-server (if you haven't done that already) by editing
      $HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf.  Also specify the auto-key-retrieve option
      for convenience.

      N.B. According to
      <http://superuser.com/questions/227991/where-to-upload-pgp-public-key-are-keyservers-still-surviving>
      the recommended keyserver (which really refers to a large pool of them
      that are deemed reliable at any given time) is
      hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net so that is what I have been using
      recently, and it appears so far to be reliable.

   ++ List keys on your keyring that have been retrieved or generated so far:

gpg --list-keys irwin

   ++Search for any previously published keys that you might want to
  revoke.  (Note the search phrase is case insensitive but the search
  is done on the Boolean AND of the terms so the following search would
  miss any key generated in the past by Alan Irwin because of the
  middle initial "W." that is specified for the search).  OTOH, I
  always use my middle initial for publications to reduce name clashes.

gpg --search-keys Alan W. Irwin

   ++ Create a new key:

gpg --gen-key

  With gnupg 1.4.10, I chose the following options when creating a new key:

Please select what kind of key you want:
  (1) RSA and RSA (default)

What keysize do you want?
2048 (default)
5-year expiration date.

....

Real name: Alan W. Irwin
Email address: airwin@users.sourceforge.net
Comment: Time Ephemerides key
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>"


N.B. nameofkey below is the name of the key, usually specified by the
second number after the slash for the first pub line given by
"gpg --list-keys".  For example, the above key gives the following
result:

software@raven> gpg --list-keys irwin
pub   2048R/BB159E92 2011-08-19 [expires: 2016-08-17]
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
sub   2048R/C5ECCF77 2011-08-19 [expires: 2016-08-17]

So the name could be BB159E92.  Other possibilities exist as well such
as "irwin", but that might not be unique.

Here is a complete recording of the gpg --edit-keys commands where I
added an additional user ID with the different comment "PLplot key" to
my existing key.  Note this technique could be used to add an
additional user ID with a different Real name or Email address as
well.

gpg --edit-key irwin
gpg> adduid
Real name: Alan W. Irwin
Email address: airwin@users.sourceforge.net
Comment: PLplot key
Okay # to accept this added subkey
... need to enter passphrase

gpg> uid 5 # to select the new user ID for additional changes
gpg> trust # select ultimate since you ultimately trust yourself.  :-)
Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

# Due to a gpg bug, the trust value looks like it is not updated, but
# it is so if you

gpg > save  # To save your changes, the trust value listed by

gpg --list-keys irwin

is correct.

If you make a mistake in adding a new user id.... (which happened to
me when I put down a wrong e-mail address).

gpg --edit-key irwin

adduid  (fill in correct e-mail address this time)
uid number (to select uid to work on for further commands
revuid  (revoke bad e-mail one)
primary (to make the new one the primary one, I am not sure that is necessary)
trust  (to make the new one ultimately trusted, again, not sure that is necessary.  N.B. didn't seem to change trust value, but that was just bad output)

save  (to get out again)

When edited the next time showed ultimate trust value for correct id,
but I don't know whether that was the above primary/trust subcommands
or whether those were necessary at all.  It turned out those were not
necessary at all as I later used the above first sequence without
trust subcommand to generate a libLASi uid key and a FreeEOS uid key.

  ++ Key Expiration:

      What to do when your key expires and you feel it is _not_
      compromised in any way.  (See
      <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/177291/how-to-renew-an-expired-keypair-with-gpg>
      for discussion of this method):

gpg --edit-key irwin
# To bump expiration date of existing key.  gpg asked some reasonable
# questions here such as how long until the next expiry (I specified
# 5y for 5 more years).  Then it asks you to verify that new expiry,
# then asks for your pass phrase and then shows the changed result.
gpg> expire
# Save results in your local keyring
gpg> save

      N.B.  The key ID (BB159E92 in my case) remains unchanged.

      Publish those changed results to a keyserver (which propagates
      them to all other key servers).

gpg --send-keys key ID

      where key ID is BB159E92 for my case.

   ++ Verify the above propagated.

      Use a different user account with keyring that has not
      been locally updated.  Then update it using

gpg --refresh-keys

      Then verified that refresh worked using, e.g.,

gpg --list-keys irwin
gpg --verify plplot-${plplot_version}.tar.gz.asc

      etc.

   ++ Generate a revocation certificate.  Note this requires the pass
      phrase specified at the time of key generation so keep that pass
      phrase in a safe place or else generate the revocation
      certificate right after generating the key, and keep that
      certificate in a safe place.  I chose the former course (keep
      the pass phrase safe).  N.B. the options should appear below in
      the order given!

gpg --armor -o nameofkey-revocation.asc --gen-revoke nameofkey

   ++ Publicly revoke old key (from FAQ):

gpg --import old-revocation.asc
gpg --send-keys nameofkey

   ++ Upload your (public) key to GPG key server pool so that others
      can obtain it to verify your signature on the release tarball.

gpg --send-keys key ID

      where key ID is BB159E92 for my case.

gpg --refresh-keys

      to update from the key server pool all keys on your keyring
      including your own.

This verified that the bad irwin address was revoked even though
gpg --search-keys Alan W. Irwin

still shows revoked uid as the #1 uid.

** Correct computer time

(While it is useful to have the correct time on your computer, this is no
longer strictly necessary).
Verify that your computer has the right date and time using the command date.
The easiest way to make sure the time and date are correct is to do the
following:
1. Install the debian ntpdate package.
2. Execute the command "/usr/sbin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org", which you will
   have to do as root.
This will immediately change your system clock. It is not recommended if you
have other apps running on your system that expect time to increase in a
smooth and linear fashion.

If you would like your computer to always have the correct time and date, you
can install the debian ntp package.  The default configuration appears
to give good results.  You can check those results by the ntpq -pe command,
e.g.,

software@raven> ntpq -dp

The delay column is the round-trip travel time (in ms) to the indicated server.

The offset column is the "combined time offset" (in ms) for the
indicated server.  I assume this is the offset of that server clock from
the weighted mean of all the clocks.

The jitter column is the "exponentially-weighted rms average" for the
indicated server.  I assume it is in ms so the above jitters of 0.000
show a very small rms for those servers, i.e., a clock of extremely
high quality.

** System prerequisites for viewing local website

You should install both apache and PHP on your computer.  For Debian Jessie
that is done (as root) by installing libapache2-mod-php5
and enabling user directories using the command

a2enmod userdir

and editing /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf as indicated in that
file to allow user directories for php.  I am not sure, but I believe
from some google results I found that editing of that file is also
necessary on modern versions of Ubuntu in order to allow php-based websites
like that of PLplot to work when installed in local user directories.

After the above changes, you must restart the apache server.  On
Debian this is done with

service apache2 restart

(When user directories are enabled this way, for the above case
where

Summary:
USERNAME = irwin
GROUPNAME = irwin
HOSTNAME = raven
WEBSITE_PREFIX = /home/irwin/public_html/plplot

that directory location browses as
http://raven/~irwin/plplot/htdocs/.)

Fix website permissions

When the release manager uploads the website, those files belong to both
him and the PLplot group.  So in theory those files can be overwritten by
anyone else belonging to the group.  But in the past, this did not work
and whenever someone else tried to upload the website (e.g., when the
release manager changed), there were lots of permission issues to deal with.

This discussion of dealing with permissions problems may be moot now
because of the--no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX options recently
introduced for the rsync command above or because Allura handles website
file permissions differently now.  But we won't know that for a
fact until someone besides the current release manager attempts to
generate the website and upload it so I will leave the following
instructions for dealing with permissions problems in place, "just in
case".

Note that when changing those who upload the website, the SF
permissions (at least in the pre-Allura version of SF) were not set
up correctly to delete files belonging to the old release manager
using rsync.

If this problem re-occurs, then one thing to try is to attempt to
mass-delete all website files using

mkdir /tmp/empty
rsync -av --delete  /tmp/empty/ airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

followed by the original rsync command above to upload the website using
the new ownership of files.

For more on the extremly non-posix permissions of the SF website files
see
<https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Project%20Web%20Filesystem%20Permissions/>
which claims, for example, that any authorized PLplot user can delete
files regardless of ownership so the above may work fine.  But that document also implies you
can change permissions from the defaults which (as reported by the
sftp "ls -l" command) are "drwxrwxr-x" for all directories and
"-rw-rw-r--" for all files.  This is indeed true using the sftp
"chmod" command which allows you to change permissions one file at a
time (ugh).  But any attempt to get rsync to change permissions from
these defaults (e.g., with the "--no-g
--chmod=Du=rwx,Dgo=rx,Fu=rw,Fgo=r" set of options with or without
-no-p and starting from empty or not) failed.

"Just in case" the above mass-deletion with rsync fails, this quite
laborious method worked to delete all files in the past.

sftp airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net

Then use the

ls -l

command to figure out who owns what and the

rm *

command on the _file_ contents of each subdirectory of htdocs, and use
the

rmdir <directory name>

command on empty directories.

Note, sftp has no recursive feature so you have to figure out the
directory structure and cd to the correct directory levels to remove
the files in each directory, ugh.  I did try the sftp chown command,
but that did not work so the only possibility I could find was the above
commands to remove htdocs and everything below it in a piece-meal fashion.
