N.B. the order of steps below is important because of the dependencies
between the steps which are noted (except for the generation of the
final release tarball and ChangeLog which depend on virtually all
prior steps).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Perform a (preliminary) search and fix for all internal inconsistencies

This step depends on no previous steps.

Some of the files in the source tree are generated from other files
in the source tree using build-system targets.  All targets that
have "check" in the name prefix are these kind of targets.  Also,
some of the checks require special setup or take too long for the
general case, and these will be configured only for the
-DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON case.

So use the above cmake option, and then for a complete list of
checks run

make help |grep '... check' |sort

in the build tree.  The current result of that command should be

... check_all
... check_api_xml_consistency
... check_fortran_parameters
... check_ifort_definitions_file
... check_libtclmatrix_capabilities
... check_plplot_h.inc
... check_plplotcapi_defines
... check_swig_documentation
... check_tcl_parameters

Note the check_api_xml_consistency target only exists if
-DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON and our build system finds the
golang application "plplot-doc-check" which has been developed
by Hǎiliàng Wang and which is executed by
that check_api_xml_consistency target.  For more details
concerning how to build and install "plplot-doc-check" and
put that result on the PATH see the commentary
in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt.

Also note that the check_api_xml_consistency target currently
($plplot_version) succeeds with the latest castxml-ready version of
plplot-doc-check.  However, golang is a bit esoteric so for now I am
excluding check_api_xml_consistency as a dependency of the check_all
target so the check_api_xml_consistency target has to be built
specifically.

Note the above check_plplot_h.inc target only exists
because -DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON implies
-DGENERATE_PLPLOT_H_INC=ON by default which in turn requires
that at least the OCaml version of the Perl regular expression library
be installed.  (On Debian the associated package name is
libpcre-ocaml-dev.)  Normally, GENERATE_PLPLOT_H_INC is OFF by default
to reduce build dependencies.

To actually do the internal consistency checks, configure PLplot with
the -DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON option and build each of the
above targets (except for check_api_xml_consistency) by building the
check_all target.  Each individual check target typically generates a
file in the build tree which is then compared (using the Unix cmp
command) with the file that is being checked in the source tree.  If
the two files are inconsistent (which can be caused by documentation
updates, for example), the cmp command complains, and you should
follow up by doing a diff between the two files to confirm that the
changes are reasonable followed by copying the build-tree version of
the file on top of the source-tree version and committing the
source-tree version.  When this process is completed, all the above
targets should run with no cmp
or other errors/warnings at all, i.e.,

software@merlin> make check_all

should normally "just work" without errors.

Then finish up such checking by building the check_api_xml_consistency
target which should also give a clean result (as of $plplot_version
with the castxml version).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Arrange preliminary comprehensive tests

This step depends on the previous step "Perform a (preliminary) search
and fix for all internal inconsistencies" because resolving those
inconsistencies that tend to grow during each release cycle can be
fairly intrusive so it is important to comprehensively test after
those intrusive changes are made.

The minimum version of CMake we currently allow is 3.13.2 on all
platforms, and currently the latest version of CMake that has been
officially released is 3.14.4.

The point of these comprehensive tests is to insure that PLplot is in
releasable state (i.e., without any release critical issues) on all
platforms for the above range of CMake versions.  Thus, these tests
should at least be done on the release manager's platform for both
versions of CMake mentioned above.  (Note the easiest way to get
access to these specific versions is by building CMake via the bootstrap
method from the appropriate gpg-verified git tags for the two
releases.)  In addition the release manager should encourage other
developers to perform comprehensive tests on their platforms to help
confirm there are no release critical bugs for those additional
platforms.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Declare a push freeze on the plplot-devel mailing list

This step should be done as soon as the first successful preliminary
comprehensive test has been completed (typically by the release
manager).  The point of this freeze is to reduce the chances of some
further change compromising the comprehensive test results (which are
typically quite time consuming to finish).  However, this freeze (on
source code and build system changes) does allow further changes
before the release such as documentation improvements, the known
build-system changes below (e.g., version changes) that are required
for an actual release, and also possibly (this is a judgement call by
the release manager in consultation with the PLplot developer that is
recommending the fix) minimal code and build system fixes for any
issues found and judged to be release critical after the first
successful preliminary comprehensive test.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Perform a (preliminary) PLplot contract test

See README.PLplot_Contract_Testing for how the release manager should
set up a PLplot contract test for their platform.  The release manager
should then perform an Experimental version of that test using the
commit ID corresponding to the SourcForge git server tip of the PLplot
master branch, i.e., the version of PLplot that is close to or the
same as the version used for the above comprehensive testing and
therefore close to the version of PLplot that will be released.  The
point here is future-proof PLplot with regard to CMake changes by
confirming that the latest development (git) version of PLplot
correctly configures, builds, and installs for the latest development
(git) version of CMake.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare a (preliminary) version of the ChangeLog file for this release

This step does not depend on other steps.

Confirm previous release tag.

git tag --list |grep "^plplot-${old_plplot_version}"

Checkout an up-to-date master branch, then create the preliminary
ChangeLog from that.

git checkout master
git log --name-status --reverse plplot-${old_plplot_version}..master >| /tmp/ChangeLog.release_preliminary

Also, create a summary of all the commit topics for quick reference.

git log --oneline --reverse plplot-${old_plplot_version}..master >| /tmp/ChangeLog.release_preliminary_summary

This file is useful, for example, for counting commits for this release cycle.

Note because of the --reverse option above the order of these logs will
be in chronological order.  But it is traditional for the final
version ChangeLog to have the result in default reverse
chronological order so the --reverse option is not used in that case
(see below).
_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare the README.release file and/or encourage those who have made
   changes in this release cycle to update that file

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Prepare a (preliminary) version of the ChangeLog file for this release".

Skim /tmp/ChangeLog.release_preliminary to make sure README.release is
complete with regards to all major developments during this release
cycle including and especially all API changes.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update versions

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Prepare the README.release file ..."

Update PLplot version in www/examples.php.  Also follow the
instructions in cmake/modules/plplot_version.cmake to update all
version information.

And because theoretically you could screw
up the version syntax (although it has never happened) test for
typographical errors in this commit with

git diff www

and

git diff cmake/modules/plplot_version.cmake |grep '^[+-]' |sort --key=1.2 |less

where in the latter case, the format of the result makes typographical errors
quite noticeable.

I can get away with the above simple tests at this stage because the final comprehensive
test below should find any issues with this change that the above simple tests
missed.

_________________________________________________________________________

** Prepare and test the documentation

This step depends on the "Update versions" step above.

Update the doxygen documentation (in our source code) and DocBook
documentation (in doc/docbook/src) to reflect any changes (new drivers
or new PLplot functionality) in the current release cycle.  Or
encourage those who made the changes to update the
documentation.

Generate and test our doxygen form of documentation following the
instructions in doc/README.doxygen.

Update your best estimate of the UTC release date which is specified
as RELEASE_DATE in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.txt.  That value might
need further revision when generating the the final website result
below.

Update, generate and test our Docbook documentation following the
instructions in doc/docbook/README.developers.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Perform a (final) search and fix for all internal inconsistencies

This step (unlike its preliminary variant above) depends on the above
"Prepare and test the documentation" step since documentation changes
can affect internal consistency.

See the discussion in the "Perform a (preliminary) search and fix for
all internal inconsistencies" step above for details.  Following what
is done there, build "plplot-doc-check" and put that application on
the PATH, e.g.,

PATH=/home/software/golang_apps:$PATH

configure PLplot with the
-DADD_SPECIAL_CONSISTENCY_CHECKING=ON option, and build the check_all
and check_api_xml_consistency targets.  If no build errors occur with
these targets, then our internal consistency checks pass for the final
form of this release.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update website-related files

This step does not depend on other steps.

Look for any fundamental standard examples changes using

git diff --ignore-all-space plplot-$old_plplot_version -- examples/lua

(I chose examples/lua here rather than examples/c since the lua
examples are normally kept right up to date with any fundamental
changes in the C examples, but without the churn that sometimes occurs
in examples/c.)

If the above test shows there is a necessity to update the examples
list in scripts/htdocs-gen_plot-examples.sh, then do that.  That list
is used to generate the website example-related files and copy the
results to the website. The list automatically controls what example
source code is configured (for source code that needs that), as well
as what example plots and example thumbnails are generated.  The list
also automatically controls what examples-related files are copied to
the website.

Update the project web page including the examples.  For example, edit
www/examples.php to reflect any changes to the examples themselves
(i.e. pages added or removed from an existing example or entirely new
examples).

Note, the xmlto package that must be installed in order to generate
the DocBook documentation (see doc/docbook/README.developers referred
to above) is also used to generate some of our older release
announcements for the website, and could also be used to generate
present release announcements for the website if desired.  See
www/announce/README for just how easy this step would be.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Install and test a (preliminary) local copy of the PLplot website

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Prepare and test the documentation" and
"Update website-related files"


N.B. The git checkout-index command exports everything from the
working directory that is in the index or committed, but it will
ignore local changes in the working directory that haven't been
"added".  So use "git add" or "git commit" judiciously before running
this script to get all local changes relevant to website generation
tested by this script.

To build the local form of the website (including both the doxygen and
DocBook forms of our documentation) run (on a Linux host that is
capable of building the documentation for the source tree that has all
local changes)

scripts/generate_website.sh

with no arguments (but with stdin configured as below using echo).
The script asks you four questions, gives you a chance to verify your
answers, then does all the rest of it (downloading a throwaway copy of
the PLplot source code, building the doxygen and DocBook
documentation, generating the announcements that are part of the base
website, uploading the base website, uploading the documentation,
building the examples, running the examples, uploading the example
source code and example results) automatically.  I (AWI) ran this
script as follows:

time (echo irwin$'\n'irwin$'\n'merlin$'\n'/home/irwin/public_html/plplot$'\n'yes |scripts/generate_website.sh)

==>

Summary:
USERNAME = irwin
GROUPNAME = irwin
HOSTNAME = merlin
WEBSITE_PREFIX = /home/irwin/public_html/plplot

(merlin is my local computer name, and /home/irwin/public_html is a
location where I can store various websites).  For the above command,
a typical time result on my Ryzen 7 1700 computer is

real    1m16.944s
user    1m30.211s
sys     0m9.983s


Check for warnings other than "too deep" explanations, doxygen warnings about FreeSans no
longer being used, and spurious autogen code warnings from doxygen

find /tmp/plplotdoc -name '*.out' |xargs grep -i warning |grep -vE '_autogen|too deep|FreeSans' |less

This turned up quite a few warnings from cmake, but they all seemed to
be ignorable (and will disappear when we change "message(STATUS
"WARNING...") cmake status messages to something else that does not
use the "warning" attribute.

Check for errors (e.g., due
to missing commands that need to be installed) by running

find /tmp/plplotdoc -name '*.out' |xargs grep -i error

doxygen did generate one error message, 

/tmp/plplotdoc/build/make_prebuild.out:Preprocessing /tmp/plplotdoc/error: NamespaceDef::insertMembers(): member `_swig_property' with class scope `' inserted in namespace scope `plplotc'!

but I attribute that to a false alarm due to incorrect doxygen parsing
of source code since the g++ compiler does not have any issues with
that swig-generated code.

I also check for changes in a lot of the web content other than
examples data such as screenshots and doxygen- and DocBook-generated
documentation using

git diff plplot-${old_plplot_version}..master www

Test the local version of the website (currently at
<http://merlin/~irwin/plplot/htdocs> as a result of the above local
website generation command) for the changes revealed by the above "git
diff" command and also check the documentation looks good, checking
the examples are complete and look good and the source code for each
language for examples is accessible, etc.  Also, test that local
website by clicking on all links.  As a result of those tests, some
iterations with the steps above entitled

"Prepare and test the documentation" and
"Update website-related files"

will likely be required.

N.B. As explained above scripts/generate_website.sh uses the index of
the git working directory (but ignores local changes which have not
yet been added to the index) as the source tree for generating the
local website.  So there is no need to commit every documentation,
example, and version change until you are completely satisfied with
the local website.  But after you _are_ satisfied with the local
website you should commit all your changes so they are available for
generating the tarball and ChangeLog (see below) for this release.

N.B. The iterated result should be identical to the final result (see
below) except for correcting (if necessary) the RELEASE_DATE as mentioned
above.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Create (a preliminary version of) the release tarball and check the
   result for errors

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Prepare and test documentation"
"Check and potentially fix internal consistency"

The -c option runs ctest on the directory tree unpacked from the
release tarball, and the -i option installs a build from that
directory tree.  N.B. be careful what you specify for the
-i option since that directory will be completely removed
initially.

N.B. the env settings below are to bypass the bad lua 5.3.3 version
available for Debian Testing, bypass the outdated/buggy version of
libLASi for Debian Testing, to test a local build of qhull, and to use
a CMake version (for our currently allowed minimum version) that has
been built on my Debian Testing platform.

time (env CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/software/lua/install-5.3.5:/home/software/lasi_svn/install:/home/software/qhull/install PATH="/home/software/cmake/install-3.13.2/bin:$PATH" scripts/make_tarball.sh -c -i /tmp/plplot_install)

A typical recent (with Ryzen 7 1700 system) time output was

real    2m20.935s
user    13m4.418s
sys     1m23.955s

Check for warnings where we ignore spurious warnings from doxygen concerning autogen code
and spurious warnings from gfortran concerning private C modules and an uninitialized argv_dynamic
variable which isn't.

find /tmp/plplot-dist-prep -name "*.out" |xargs grep -i warning |grep -vE '_autogen|is marked PRIVATE|argv_dynamic' |less

The remaining warnings appear to be fairly numerous, but in all cases innocuous such as
known cmake warnings.

Check for errors.

find /tmp/plplot-dist-prep -name "*.out" |xargs grep -i error

This search found two innocuous hits.

Look at the ctest results:

less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/ctest_build_dir/ctest.out
less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/ctest_build_dir/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

Compare the following install locations that were generated from the
tarball with the corresponding local website that was generated above.

diff -Naur --exclude=HTML-MANIFEST /tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/html /home/irwin/public_html/plplot/htdocs/docbook-manual/plplot-html-5.15.0 |less

diff -Naur /tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/doxygen/html/index.html /home/irwin/public_html/plplot/htdocs/doxygen/html/ |less

cmp /tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/plplot-$plplot_version.pdf /home/irwin/public_html/plplot/htdocs/docbook-manual/plplot-$plplot_version.pdf

The first comparison showed no differences, the second comparison showed one generated datestamp change,
and the last comparison showed the binary blobs were different (likely due to a datestamp) so follow
up by browsing /tmp/plplot_install/share/doc/plplot/plplot-$plplot_version.pdf to make sure all
is well for that PDF.

Look at tarball contents to make sure included filenames are
what is intended.

less /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz

Also compare the table of contents of that tarball for the previous release with the present release.

tar ztf ../export/plplot-$old_plplot_version.tar.gz |sort >| /tmp/${old_plplot_version}.out
tar ztf /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz |sed -e "s?${plplot_version}?${old_plplot_version}?g" |sort >| /tmp/${plplot_version}.out
diff -au /tmp/${old_plplot_version}.out /tmp/${plplot_version}.out | less

Look at a few man pages that were generated from the tarball, e.g.,

man -M/tmp/plplot_install/share/man pllegend
man -M/tmp/plplot_install/share/man plsurf3dl

Look at the info pages that were generated from the tarball using

info /tmp/plplot_install/share/info/plplotdoc.info
_________________________________________________________________________

** Do comprehensive test of PLplot

This step depends on the steps above entitled

"Check and potentially fix internal consistency"
"Update date/versions"

To make sure there have been no issues introduced since the previous
preliminary comprehensive tests (which were performed both for the
minimum CMake version and the latest CMake release) do the following
comprehensive test using the minimum CMake version.  (Repeating this
test for the latest CMake version could also be done, but assuming all
is well for the minimum version such an additional test is considered
to be overkill.)

# Specify COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PREFIX and SOURCE_PREFIX such that this
# is done with blank-prefixed source, build, and install trees to
# test such blanks in those directory names do not cause build-system
# problems.

# Set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to access local versions of lua and libLASi to
# avoid important bugs in the Debian Testing versions of those
# packages.  Also access a local version of libqhull to test
# that additional rpath possibility.
    
# Put a local build of CMake-3.13.2 first on the PATH to thoroughly test our
# build system for our new minimum version of CMake.
    
# Use the -DUSE_INCRTCL_VERSION_4=ON option to help CMake find Tcl/Tk
# components. (This step will not be necessary as soon as the PLplot
# build system is modified to make Tcl/Tk/Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets finding
# more robust.)
    
# Use -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=/home/software/swig/install/bin/swig to test a pre-release version
# of swig-4.0.0.
    
# Apply no constraints to limit the tests.

COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PREFIX="/home/software/plplot/HEAD/comprehensive_test_disposeable blank"
SOURCE_PREFIX="/home/software/plplot/HEAD/plplot blank .git"
time (nice -19 env CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/software/lua/install-5.3.5:/home/software/lasi_svn/install:/home/software/qhull/install PATH="/home/software/cmake/install-3.13.2/bin:$PATH" "$SOURCE_PREFIX"/scripts/comprehensive_test.sh --prefix "$COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PREFIX" --cmake_added_options "-DUSE_INCRTCL_VERSION_4=ON -DSWIG_EXECUTABLE=/home/software/swig/install/bin/swig" --build_command "make -j16" --ctest_command "ctest -j16" --do_submit_dashboard yes)

After this script completes, follow the evaluation procedure for
comprehensive test results documented in
doc/wiki_source/Testing_PLplot.  Assuming all goes well with that, you
have proved that the changes since the preliminary comprehensive test
have not introduced any issues in this comprehensive test (at least
for the minimum CMake version).
_________________________________________________________________________

Install and test a local copy of the PLplot website

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Install and test a (preliminary) local copy of the PLplot website"

Follow the exact instructions given in that step except this time correct
RELEASE_DATE (configured in doc/docbook/src/CMakeLists.text) if
necessary.  Here is the command I used for this step

echo irwin$'\n'irwin$'\n'merlin$'\n'/home/irwin/public_html/plplot$'\n'yes | scripts/generate_website.sh
_________________________________________________________________________

Upload the local website to SourceForge

Once you are satisfied with the local website, you should upload it to
SourceForge with rsync.

For the above WEBSITE_PREFIX, here is what worked for me from my computer
with the hostname of merlin where that WEBSITE_PREFIX directory was
created.

rsync -av --delete --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX \
/home/irwin/public_html/plplot/htdocs/ \
airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

Adjust for your username and WEBSITE_PREFIX.  The ",plplot" part of the
username makes sure you have the right group permissions and default website
directory location for PLplot.

The --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX options were introduced recently and
are recommended by the rsync man page to preserve SourceForge's file
and directory attributes.  It is only with those options that I am
able to get a clean result for a second rsync run.  (Otherwise, each
directory is mentioned as being changed.)  These options may solve the
website permissions problem mentioned in an Appendix.

N.B. the trailing slash on the source directory is essential and means rsync
the contents of this directory with the contents of the destination htdocs
directory.  Without the trailing slash you would rsync the the contents of
the source directory with the contents of the htdocs/htdocs destination
directory which is not what you want to do.

N.B. the --dry-run option for rsync is a godsend since it tells you exactly what
will happen without actually doing it.

Once you have a proper upload of the local website to SourceForge, test
it as before.  Also, click the xhtml and css validate buttons on each of
index.php, download.php, examples.php, documentation.php, and credits.php
to validate those pages.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Commit the changes in this file (README.Release_Manager_CookBook)

This step depends on all prior steps since at least some of them have
likely been edited to reflect changed release manager practices
as the release process has unfolded.

Make sure this file reflects the latest practices by the release
manager.  That is, if some prior step has been taken in a way that is
not properly documented in this file, you should update that section
of this file (and hopefully you have done that for each of the above
parts of the document as the step was taken).  Note, that at this
stage we should be ready for the actual release and all the subsequent
steps should need little or no additional editing for any release, but
if some release practice changes for any of the subsequent steps, then
this file should be changed accordingly after this release.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Update and commit README.cumulated_release

This step depends on all previous changes (and subsequent tweaks)
of README.release.
Once you are completely satisfied with README.release, then preserve
the historical record of the significant changes between versions of
PLplot in one file by prepending README.release for $plplot_version to
README.cumulated_release.

cat README.release README.cumulated_release > README.cumulated_release_new
mv README.cumulated_release_new README.cumulated_release
_________________________________________________________________________

** Push new version of ChangeLog.release for this release

N.B. commit all local changes to the repository so they will be
reflected in the ChangeLog, tagged version of the release, and the
release tarball.  And if there are committed changes after this one
repeat this step so the ChangeLog.release commit is the last commit on
master for this release cycle (with the possible exception of the
current file, README.Release_Manager_Cookbook).

Prepare the ChangeLog.release file to keep track of all changes
made for the release.  Make sure master and maint are up to date using

git checkout master
git fetch
git log --oneline -1 origin/master
git log --oneline -1 master
git log --oneline -1 maint

Create final ChangeLog for this release

# maint is a private topic branch I use for maintenance which I keep
# identical to master (confirmed with above git log commands) before I
# start using it.
git checkout maint
git log --name-status plplot-${old_plplot_version}..master >| ChangeLog.release

Note this result (unlike the prelimary version above) will be in the
traditional reverse chronological order.

# Commit, fast-forward merge to master, and push

git add ChangeLog.release
git commit
# There is a chicken/egg situation here since the ChangeLog.release file
# does not include the log of its own last commit.  You could address
# that issue by re-running the above commit command, and amending the commit.
# However, that amending will change the commit id so the ChangeLog.release
# will have incorrect information about its own commmit id.
# So the best course is not to do such amending and accept that the
# ChangeLog.release file will not include the log of the last commit (i.e., its own commit)
# for the release.

git checkout master
#Last check there is nothing to download from server.
git fetch
# Only if git fetch did not download anything....
git merge --ff-only maint
git push origin master

This should be the last push for this release.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Contract test of the last push of this release

This step depends on the step above entitled

"Push new version of ChangeLog.release for this release"

Adjust your configuration of the contract test (in my case it is
located at ~/cmake/Dashboards/Scripts/CMakeScripts/my_dashboard.cmake)
so that the pushed commit above is used for the test, and then launch
that contract test.  In my case that is done with

time (nice -19 /usr/bin/ctest -S ~/cmake/Dashboards/Scripts/CMakeScripts/my_dashboard.cmake -VV >| ctest.out 2>&1)

This normally completes in ~20 minutes or so for my Ryzen 7 1700 computer, and you should check the site
https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=CMake for your particular dashboard (mine
is labelled "merlin") and confirm that the particular test there for
your platform called "Contracts.PLplot" (i) passed, and (ii) indeed used the correct commit id for
PLplot!
_________________________________________________________________________

** Create the PLplot Release

   ++ Preliminaries

The preliminaries are very simple with git.  Stay on master and
change nothing there for the following tests of this release.


   ++ Create a final release tarball and check the result for errors

Follow the above step entitled

"Create (a preliminary version of) the release tarball and check the result for errors"

but this time for the current last commit of master (which includes
the latest ChangeLog.release) to make sure the
tarball is exactly consistent with the release tag that will be
created for that commit (if all is well).


   ++ Tag the release

Assuming all is well with the release tarball tests, then tag (with
signed key) HEAD of master and push it.

git checkout master

A list of your GPG keys can be obtained using, e.g.,

software@merlin> gpg --list-keys Alan
pub   rsa2048 2011-08-19 [SC] [expires: 2021-12-12]
      A7CED6D2D4903103FCDDFC1E418B8FC4BB159E92
uid           [ultimate] Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid           [ultimate] Alan W. Irwin (libLASi key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid           [ultimate] Alan W. Irwin (FreeEOS key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
uid           [ultimate] Alan W. Irwin (PLplot key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>

The A7CED6D2D4903103FCDDFC1E418B8FC4BB159E92 field above is the "key" (heh) one.

Also, a new curveball thrown by the Debian Testing version of gpg is you must identify
the tty you are using with, e.g.,

export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

(see remarks at <https://www.elliotblackburn.com/importing-pgp-keys-from-keybase-into-gpg/>)

Otherwise, in my experience, gpg will refuse to sign the tag and you will get the error:

error: gpg failed to sign the data
error: unable to sign the tag

But with the above trick, the following command just worked.

git tag -u A7CED6D2D4903103FCDDFC1E418B8FC4BB159E92 --message="PLplot ${plplot_version} release" plplot-${plplot_version}
# Note, a tag simply tags a particular commit so if I checkout some
# other branch (such as maint) that has the same tagged commit as
# as master, then the "git tag --list" command will find the tag
# (which I proved was actually true for maint).

# Verify signature (which also confirms the above tag message)

git tag --verify plplot-${plplot_version}

# Irrevocable step since no pushed tags can ever be deleted from
# upstream repository.
git push origin plplot-${plplot_version}

(Note we are changing release tag names here from the old scheme
which would have been v5_11_0 to a more informative scheme for names.)

   ++ Sign the release with your plplot Release Manager gpg key


gpg --default-key A7CED6D2D4903103FCDDFC1E418B8FC4BB159E92 --detach-sign --armor /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz

where A7CED6D2D4903103FCDDFC1E418B8FC4BB159E92 refers to the public key for Alan W. Irwin as taken from the above key list.

   ++ Verify the release tarball signing

gpg --verify /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

   ++ Make a SourceForge file release

#IMPORTANT
cd /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/

sftp airwin,plplot@frs.sourceforge.net <<EOF
cd /home/frs/project/p/pl/plplot/plplot

gpg --verify plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

# Check and verify download from SF works:

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/plplot/plplot/${plplot_version}%20Source/plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz
gpg --verify plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz.asc

Prepare concatenated release notes + Changelog.

cd /tmp/plplot-dist-prep/plplot-$plplot_version
echo "

cd /tmp
sftp airwin,plplot@frs.sourceforge.net <<EOF
cd /home/frs/project/p/pl/plplot/plplot/${plplot_version}\ Source
put /tmp/README.release
exit
EOF

Make, e.g., plplot-$plplot_version.tar.gz, the "latest" version.

login to SF website with firefox
files ==> plplot ==> ${plplot_version} Source ==> view details (the "i" icon) for
plplot-${plplot_version}.tar.gz and hit the "select all" button and "save" button

It finishes with a "file properties updated" message, and appears to "take"
immediately.

Note also, the above does not work with konqueror because enabling ".sourceforge.net" under
javascript does not appear to cover all the javascript stuff that the sourceforge site users.
(firefox accepts javascript from any source so does not have this problem, but is insecure
as a result).

   ++ Make a SourceForge news item concerning this release

Create a news item for this release largely following previous
news items (or even identical to them but with a changed title).

Point your browser to http://sourceforge.net/projects/plplot and login.  A
news item will then be available on the menu bar.  Click that, then
"new post".

Enter the title (e.g., PLplot $plplot_version has been released) and
the text.  The text is in markdown format so copying and pasting from
a previous news item (using the ctrl-c command on the editing area of
the old release notes to copy and ctrl-v command on the new release
notes editing area since normal cutting and pasting no longer works)
is a very efficient way to create the new news item.  After that copy
and paste, remember to change all occurrences of $old_plplot_version
to $plplot_version within the text, and also to update the highlights
area (by copying from the list of "2. Improvements relative to the
previous release) in README.release and changing all the numbers to
"*").

   ++ Publicize the release announcement

   Normally all we do these days is publicize the new release on the
   plplot-general mailing list, but in the past Jerry has publicized
   our releases on macresearch.org, and Barbara Irwin has publicized
   our releases on linuxtoday.com, lwn.net, and lxer.com.

   ++ Prepare immediately for the next release cycle

  a. Commit last-minute tweaks (e.g., in README.Release_Manager_Cookbook)
     that did not make it into the official tarball of the release or
     official tag of the release.

  b. Update README.release file to reflect the start of a new release
     cycle.  Keep the opening paragraphs and sections 1.1, 2.1, 2.2,
     and 3 since those parts will only be changed a small amount for
     the next release.  But you can drop Sections 1.[2-?] and 2.[2-?]
     since those are only relevant to the present release and not the
     next release.  Also any details mentioned in Section 2.1
     concerning specific bug fixes should be dropped since those are
     obviously not relevant to the next release.

  c. Configure the contract test as above (but this time using the
     commit id "plplot-${plplot_version}", and then run it and
     evaluate the test as above.

** GNU Privacy Guard (gpg)
A brief summary of developer relevant gpg commands, see also:
http://dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto.html,
man gpg, and http://www.gnupg.org/faq/GnuPG-FAQ.html.

   ++ Configure key-server (if you haven't done that already) by editing
      $HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf.  Also specify the auto-key-retrieve option
      for convenience.

      N.B. According to
      <http://superuser.com/questions/227991/where-to-upload-pgp-public-key-are-keyservers-still-surviving>
      the recommended keyserver (which really refers to a large pool of them
      that are deemed reliable at any given time) is
      hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net so that is what I have been using
      recently, and it appears so far to be reliable.

   ++ List keys on your keyring that have been retrieved or generated so far:

gpg --list-keys irwin

   ++Search for any previously published keys that you might want to
  revoke.  (Note the search phrase is case insensitive but the search
  is done on the Boolean AND of the terms so the following search would
  miss any key generated in the past by Alan Irwin because of the
  middle initial "W." that is specified for the search).  OTOH, I
  always use my middle initial for publications to reduce name clashes.

gpg --search-keys Alan W. Irwin

   ++ Create a new key:

gpg --gen-key

  With gnupg 1.4.10, I chose the following options when creating a new key:

Please select what kind of key you want:
  (1) RSA and RSA (default)

What keysize do you want?
2048 (default)
5-year expiration date.

....

Real name: Alan W. Irwin
Email address: airwin@users.sourceforge.net
Comment: Time Ephemerides key
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>"


N.B. nameofkey below is the name of the key, usually specified by the
second number after the slash for the first pub line given by
"gpg --list-keys".  For example, the above key gives the following
result:

software@merlin> gpg --list-keys irwin
pub   2048R/BB159E92 2011-08-19 [expires: 2016-08-17]
uid                  Alan W. Irwin (Time Ephemerides key) <airwin@users.sourceforge.net>
sub   2048R/C5ECCF77 2011-08-19 [expires: 2016-08-17]

So the name could be BB159E92.  Other possibilities exist as well such
as "irwin", but that might not be unique.

Here is a complete recording of the gpg --edit-keys commands where I
added an additional user ID with the different comment "PLplot key" to
my existing key.  Note this technique could be used to add an
additional user ID with a different Real name or Email address as
well.

gpg --edit-key irwin
gpg> adduid
Real name: Alan W. Irwin
Email address: airwin@users.sourceforge.net
Comment: PLplot key
Okay # to accept this added subkey
... need to enter passphrase

gpg> uid 5 # to select the new user ID for additional changes
gpg> trust # select ultimate since you ultimately trust yourself.  :-)
Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

# Due to a gpg bug, the trust value looks like it is not updated, but
# it is so if you

gpg > save  # To save your changes, the trust value listed by

gpg --list-keys irwin

is correct.

If you make a mistake in adding a new user id.... (which happened to
me when I put down a wrong e-mail address).

gpg --edit-key irwin

adduid  (fill in correct e-mail address this time)
uid number (to select uid to work on for further commands
revuid  (revoke bad e-mail one)
primary (to make the new one the primary one, I am not sure that is necessary)
trust  (to make the new one ultimately trusted, again, not sure that is necessary.  N.B. didn't seem to change trust value, but that was just bad output)

save  (to get out again)

When edited the next time showed ultimate trust value for correct id,
but I don't know whether that was the above primary/trust subcommands
or whether those were necessary at all.  It turned out those were not
necessary at all as I later used the above first sequence without
trust subcommand to generate a libLASi uid key and a FreeEOS uid key.

  ++ Key Expiration:

      What to do when your key expires and you feel it is _not_
      compromised in any way.  (See
      <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/177291/how-to-renew-an-expired-keypair-with-gpg>
      for discussion of this method):

gpg --edit-key irwin
# To bump expiration date of existing key.  gpg asked some reasonable
# questions here such as how long until the next expiry (I specified
# 5y for 5 more years).  Then it asks you to verify that new expiry,
# then asks for your pass phrase and then shows the changed result.
gpg> expire
# Save results in your local keyring
gpg> save

      N.B.  The key ID (BB159E92 in my case) remains unchanged.

      Publish those changed results to a keyserver (which propagates
      them to all other key servers).

gpg --send-keys key ID

      where key ID is BB159E92 for my case.

   ++ Verify the above propagated.

      Use a different user account with keyring that has not
      been locally updated.  Then update it using

gpg --refresh-keys

      Then verified that refresh worked using, e.g.,

gpg --list-keys irwin
gpg --verify plplot-${plplot_version}.tar.gz.asc

      etc.

   ++ Generate a revocation certificate.  Note this requires the pass
      phrase specified at the time of key generation so keep that pass
      phrase in a safe place or else generate the revocation
      certificate right after generating the key, and keep that
      certificate in a safe place.  I chose the former course (keep
      the pass phrase safe).  N.B. the options should appear below in
      the order given!

gpg --armor -o nameofkey-revocation.asc --gen-revoke nameofkey

   ++ Publicly revoke old key (from FAQ):

gpg --import old-revocation.asc
gpg --send-keys nameofkey

   ++ Upload your (public) key to GPG key server pool so that others
      can obtain it to verify your signature on the release tarball.

gpg --send-keys key ID

      where key ID is BB159E92 for my case.

gpg --refresh-keys

      to update from the key server pool all keys on your keyring
      including your own.

This verified that the bad irwin address was revoked even though
gpg --search-keys Alan W. Irwin

still shows revoked uid as the #1 uid.
_________________________________________________________________________

** Correct computer time

(While it is useful to have the correct time on your computer, this is no
longer strictly necessary).
Verify that your computer has the right date and time using the command date.
The easiest way to make sure the time and date are correct is to do the
following:
1. Install the debian ntpdate package.
2. Execute the command "/usr/sbin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org", which you will
   have to do as root.
This will immediately change your system clock. It is not recommended if you
have other apps running on your system that expect time to increase in a
smooth and linear fashion.

If you would like your computer to always have the correct time and date, you
can install the debian ntp package.  The default configuration appears
to give good results.  You can check those results by the ntpq -pe command,
e.g.,

software@merlin> ntpq -dp
1 packets reassembled into response
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter

The delay column is the round-trip travel time (in ms) to the indicated server.

The offset column is the "combined time offset" (in ms) for the
indicated server.  I assume this is the offset of that server clock from
the weighted mean of all the clocks.

The jitter column is the "exponentially-weighted rms average" for the
indicated server.  I assume it is in ms so the above jitters of 0.000
show a very small rms for those servers, i.e., a clock of extremely
high quality.
_________________________________________________________________________

** System prerequisites for viewing local website

You should install both apache and PHP on your computer.  For Debian Testing
that is done (as root) by installing libapache2-mod-php
and enabling user directories using the command

a2enmod userdir

and editing /etc/apache2/mods-available/php7.2.conf as indicated in that
file to allow user directories for php.  I am not sure, but I believe
from some google results I found that editing of that file is also
necessary on modern versions of Ubuntu in order to allow php-based websites
like that of PLplot to work when installed in local user directories.

After the above changes, you must restart the apache server.  On
Debian this is done with

systemctl restart apache2

(When user directories are enabled this way, for the above case
where

Summary:
USERNAME = irwin
GROUPNAME = irwin
HOSTNAME = merlin
WEBSITE_PREFIX = /home/irwin/public_html/plplot

that directory location browses as
<http://merlin/~irwin/plplot/htdocs/>.)
_________________________________________________________________________

Fix website permissions

When the release manager uploads the website, those files belong to both
him and the PLplot group.  So in theory those files can be overwritten by
anyone else belonging to the group.  But in the past, this did not work
and whenever someone else tried to upload the website (e.g., when the
release manager changed), there were lots of permission issues to deal with.

This discussion of dealing with permissions problems may be moot now
because of the--no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX options recently
introduced for the rsync command above or because Allura handles website
file permissions differently now.  But we won't know that for a
fact until someone besides the current release manager attempts to
generate the website and upload it so I will leave the following
instructions for dealing with permissions problems in place, "just in
case".

Note that when changing those who upload the website, the SF
permissions (at least in the pre-Allura version of SF) were not set
up correctly to delete files belonging to the old release manager
using rsync.

If this problem re-occurs, then one thing to try is to attempt to
mass-delete all website files using

mkdir /tmp/empty
rsync -av --delete  /tmp/empty/ airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

followed by the original rsync command above to upload the website using
the new ownership of files.

For more on the extremly non-posix permissions of the SF website files
see
<https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Project%20Web%20Filesystem%20Permissions/>
which claims, for example, that any authorized PLplot user can delete
files regardless of ownership so the above may work fine.  But that document also implies you
can change permissions from the defaults which (as reported by the
sftp "ls -l" command) are "drwxrwxr-x" for all directories and
"-rw-rw-r--" for all files.  This is indeed true using the sftp
"chmod" command which allows you to change permissions one file at a
time (ugh).  But any attempt to get rsync to change permissions from
these defaults (e.g., with the "--no-g
--chmod=Du=rwx,Dgo=rx,Fu=rw,Fgo=r" set of options with or without
-no-p and starting from empty or not) failed.

"Just in case" the above mass-deletion with rsync fails, this quite
laborious method worked to delete all files in the past.

sftp airwin,plplot@web.sourceforge.net

Then use the

ls -l

command to figure out who owns what and the

rm *

command on the _file_ contents of each subdirectory of htdocs, and use
the

rmdir <directory name>

command on empty directories.

Note, sftp has no recursive feature so you have to figure out the
directory structure and cd to the correct directory levels to remove
the files in each directory, ugh.  I did try the sftp chown command,
but that did not work so the only possibility I could find was the above
commands to remove htdocs and everything below it in a piece-meal fashion.
