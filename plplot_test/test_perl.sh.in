# To build the c examples before running this script do the following:
# pushd $cdir; make; popd

# Do the standard non-interactive examples.
# skip 14 because it requires two output files.
# skip 17 because it is interactive.

# Ensure correct version of the libraries are picked up in both the build
# tree and install tree.
