# for USERNAME, GROUPNAME, HOSTNAME, and WEBSITE_PREFIX for this script
# and browsing http://raven/~irwin/plplot/htdocs/ afterward.

# Once you are satisfied with the local version of the website, then upload
# it to the official PLplot SourceForge site using the new (as of
# 2008-09-19) rsync procedure documented in README.Release_Manager_Cookbook.
