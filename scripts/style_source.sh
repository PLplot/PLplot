# This script will run uncrustify on all source files registered in
# the lists below (and scripts/convert_comment.py on all C source
# files registered below) and summarize which uncrustified or
# comment-converted files would be different.  (convert_comment.py
# converts /* ... */ style comments to the c99-acceptable // form of
# comments because uncrustify does not (yet) have that configuration
# choice.)  Also there are options to view the differences in detail
# and/or apply them.  This script must be run from the top-level
# directory of the PLplot source tree.

Usage: ./style_source.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
   [--diff [diff options]]  Show detailed style differences in source code
                            with optional concatenated diff options headed
                            by a single hyphen.  If no diff options are
                            specified, then -auw is used by default.
   [--nodiff]               Summarize style differences in source code (default).
   [--apply]                Apply style differences to source code (POWERFUL).
   [--noapply]              Do not apply style differences to source code (default).
   [--help]                 Show this message.
